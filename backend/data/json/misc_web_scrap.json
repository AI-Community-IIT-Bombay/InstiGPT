It served as a support group for those in advanced stages of their doctoral research. The range of papers presented indicated two major areas within innovation that could be further explored in future research. These areas are creativity and visual representation. The seminar brought out the centrality of case studies to innovation research. The presentations also shed light on various experimental scenarios that could contribute to research in the discipline.\nSome initial ideas for a paper on research methodology in the area of innovation were put together during the seminar. The seminar also provided an opportunity to the presenters to explore the possibility of collaborating on papers that could combine the insights and approaches of their respective research areas.\nNews and Awards (/event/news-and-awards)\nSchedule (/event/schedule)\nAcademic Calender (/event/academic-calender)\nWorkshops/Seminars (/event/workshopsseminars)\nAnnual Degree Show\n(/event/annual-degree-show)\nStudent Festivals (/event/student-festivals)\nHome (/)\n/ Events (/events)\n/ Research : The Seed of Innovation",

Chakravarthy (http://www.idc.iitb.ac.in/people/faculty/chakravarthy-b-k)\nIDC School of Design\nCo-Principal investigators: Prof. Nina Sabnani (http://www.idc.iitb.ac.in/people/faculty/sabnani-nina)\n& Prof. P. Kumaresan (http://www.idc.iitb.ac.in/people/faculty/kums-p-kumaresan)\nIDC School of Design\nThe objective of the Open Design School (ODS) is to extend the reach of Design education through a combination of online courses and projects in a blended learning mode.\nHence it is a combination of MOOCs and Experiential Learning. The aims of the Open Design School are to bring design education to a large number of aspirants and to provide them with hands-on training in workshops all over the country under expert mentors. Design faculty can use the online content and guide student projects locally combining the advantages of MOOCs and blended learning.\n30% of the learning can be facilitated through theory and case studies presented via MOOCs and the remaining 70% could be in the form of experiential learning through projects wherein learners would benefit from interaction with both mentors and peers.\nThe courses developed under this initiative are currently offered on the SWAYAM portal and the\nNPTEL platform of MHRD as Credit courses where the aspirants can give an exam at the end of a scheduled lecture and earn credits as well as Self-paced courses where the aspirants can learn freely at their pace. All the courses are free of cost and there is a nominal charge to conduct an exam for the credit courses.\nColleges can offer these courses to their students in their regular classes and grade them as per their own rules while feeling free to offer projects locally through local mentors.",

In this context, design has a greater role to play. Designers of today are not only being called upon to decide how a product will look, but also how it will behave and what it will do. These products not only need to meet the expressed and latent needs of users, they also need to satisfy cultural aspirations of real people and bring about a desirable societal change.\nDesigners in the new millennium need deeper understanding of users than they ever did before. In this group, we blend ethnographic approaches with traditional techniques of data gathering. We experiment with practices of watching people, analyzing findings and generating and evaluating design ideas.\nGroup Members:\nProf. U A Athavankar\nProf. Ravi Poovaiah\nProf. Anirudha Joshi\nInterfaces for All:\nThe aim of the project is to research in new paradigms of interaction design for next generation users of technology - people across literacy, language, age, gender and social barriers. We use ethnographic approach in understanding needs and problems of users, innovation and creativity in design and deployment and iterative evaluation for usability and appropriateness.\nThese are some of the projects of the group:\n. Text input in Indian languages (Keylekh, E-lekh, Dynakey)\n. New paradigms in software interfaces (Bhav Pucchiye, aAQUA) . Tangible user interfaces (Hardware browser)\n.

Our research interest include:\nFour Dimensional Imaging of Electronic Motion: The motion of atoms within molecule and solid that is associated with physical and chemical transformations occurs on femtosecond timescale, whereas the electronic motion can be even faster, on the order of attoseconds timescale. In order to understand the functionality and dynamic behavior of ultrafast physical, and chemical processes completely, it is essential to have a complete four-dimensional imaging (three spatial and one temporal) of electronic motion with sub-angstrom spatial and few-femtoseconds to several hundreds of attoseconds temporal resolutions, respectively, in real-space and in real-time. Moreover, imaging and manipulating the electronic motion on ultrafast timescale provide novel pathways towards controlling ultrafast processes. In this direction, we use time-resolved ultrafast x-ray scattering in pump-probe scenario where a pump laser pulse initiate the ultrafast process which is followed by the second probe pulse with duration shorter than the timescale of the ultrafast process. By varying the pump-probe delay time, we could record the current state of the process like a snapshot and obtain the individual images of a slow-motion electronic movie. Since electrons provide the glue that binds atoms together to form molecules, the ability to image and control electrons in matter could have revolutionary consequences for applications.",

However, to know whether the response time to the absorption of light is finite leading to a time delay in photoemission or the ejection of the photoelectron occurs instantaneously was not possible until recently. A finite time delay between photoemission processes corresponding to different valence orbitals has been measured experimentally. A ubiquitous understanding in all these measurements is the dominant influence of electron correlations to determine the temporal behavior of ejected electrons. Understanding the response time of light to the matter has a very important role in pump- probe spectroscopy and can be used to calibrate time zero in pump-probe delay time with a precision of a few attoseconds.\nRef : https://ultrafastlabiitb.wixsite.com (https://ultrafastlabiitb.wixsite.com)",

Unfortunately, I am sorry to disappoint you all. These poetries are the result of my attempt to keep in touch with my mother tongue: Hindi. As I spend almost a decade in Germany and I realized that I am losing my ability to write in Hindi. So I started writing. Now, I get motivation from different corners. I wish to write long poetry in the future. 2. Is there any scope for your Nature paper paving the way for some commercial technology? Will it affect our daily lives somehow? The main aim of our work, published in Nature Communications 2018, is to know the polarisation state of attosecond pulse, which has broad-energy bandwidth. The polarisation state of attosecond pulse changes shot to shot in time. So the polarisation state becomes time-dependent. In our work, we provided a method to know time-dependent polarisation and to distinguish the polarized, partially polarized and unpolarised pulse. Characterization of polarization of the pulse is essential to understand any chiral-sensitive light-matter interaction such as magnetization dynamics of spins, a distinction between left and right-handed chiral molecules. Chiral distinction is crucial in several research areas like drug-industry, biochemistry etc. The effect of the molecules depends on their handedness e.g. the same molecule but with different handedness is found in orange and lemon. Many biological molecules including DNA, proteins, lipids etc. have handedness. Therefore, understanding the chirality of molecules (handedness) is of utmost importance. 3. Why did you choose to get into academia instead of the industry? Creativity and freedom. More importantly, I have the freedom to switch from one research topic to other topics of my interest.

I would love to do some work in R&D sector, but not much work is going on in our country. 4. What captured your interest initially in the field of ultra-fast optics? Why did you get into it? After finishing my Ph. D. in atomic and molecular spectroscopy, I was exploring some exciting topics for my further research. This was the time when XFEL (x-ray free-electron laser) related research started and I got an opportunity to work on time-resolved x-ray scattering. Later, I explored other interesting topics such as Petahertz Electronics. Ultrafast optics or, I would say, ultrafast/attosecond science is the field where you could really explore several interesting questions and verify many fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics such as finding whether time is an operator or not, photoionization process is an instantaneous process or not, how to watch the bond-breaking or bond-making events during a chemical reaction, etc. 5. What are the main challenges that you face in your research? There are several challenges. The first and foremost is that few groups are working in attosecond science in our country. So, I am lacking an environment for scientific discussion and exchange of ideas. Both are the essential pillars for frontier research. Another aspect is not having enough awareness about attosecond science between academicians and researchers in our country. 6. Where do you get all your university t-shirts? I like having creative t-shirts. Whenever I see a uniquely designed t-shirt, I want to get a hold of it. But, sometimes my academic position and design of the t-shirt do not go hand-in-hand. Whenever I visit some university, I buy some souvenirs. T-shirts are one among many. Sometimes, I receive them as gifts from my colleagues around the globe. 7.

    "doc": "1. What do you think will be the next big thing in your field? How do you plan to be a part of it? Observations of binary black hole merger events in gravitational wave window have improved our understanding of compact binaries. Gravitational wave observations provided clear evidence of stellar mass black holes greater than 25 solar mass. With X-observations, astronomers have detected stellar mass black holes lower than 25 solar mass. We expect the coming LIGO-Virgo runs to shine light on the black hole masses and their distribution in the Universe! So far, there is no direct evidence for the existence of intermediate mass black holes (IMBH) (black holes with mass higher than 100 solar mass and lower than 100000 solar mass). IMBHs play a key role in the formation of supermassive black holes and galaxy formation. Observation of compact binary hosting IMBH would be an exciting discovery and will test some of these scenarios related galaxy formation. Currently, my research group is involved in the IMBH binary search in the LIGO-Virgo data and we will continue this activity in the next observing run about to begin in a couple of months. 2. How and why are the upgraded Advanced LIGO detectors going to be better than current ones? The aim of upgradation is to lower the noise floor making the interferometer more sensitive in the frequency band. There are many upgradations while preparing for the next observation run. To name a few, laser with high power will be used to improve the photon shot noise at higher frequencies. The squeezed light injection will be used to improve the noise floor. 3.

In a large scale collaboration such as LIGO, what is the status of independent research performed by an individual or a small group of scientists? Though LIGO Scientific Collaboration is a large collaboration, it includes experts from gravity, cosmologist, astrophysicist, data science, numerical relativity, laser physicists, suspension experts, engineers etc. This list goes on. The research problems we deal with require all this expertise. Given that, there are many small groups who work on dedicated research problems of their interest. So finally, our interaction is limited to a small set of people with common interest. There is enough scope to work on your ideas and publish the results. In fact, if the idea is interesting, one can apply on the real data and test it. We get critical feedback within collaboration which is quite valuable and improves the work. It has scope to do your own research as well as for the collaboration work. My PhD students have always done both during their PhDs. 6. What are the main challenges that you face in your research? Keeping up with time. Currently, there is so much to do and detectors are doing so well. Gravitational wave astronomy is going to explode with more and more events very soon. 7.

The group has also analysed SSM/I and AMSR-E data for soil moisture mapping over India. Active microwave sensing was started in CSRE in 1989 with Canadian Intera airborne X-SAR data acquired over Rajahmundry and Andamann and Nicolbar Islands. As part the project, various SAR filters and classification techniques were implemented. The data were also used for land use/land cover analysis. With the Announcement of opportunity given by ESA and Jaxa, CSRE got several SAR images from ERS-1/2 and JERS-1 satellites over India and anlysed the data for various applications such as backscattering properties of different objects, classification of agriculture fields, soil moisture mapping, etc.. The group also actively participated with Shuttle Imaging Radar (SIR-C) mission flights in 1994 and collected filed data synchronous with SIR-C passes over Gujarat, India. Several tandem data sets were acquired over India and used them for DEM generation. Differential InSAR technique was demonstrated using ERS-1/2 SAR images acquired over Indian glaciers and Chmoli earthquake affected areas. Several workshop/conferences/training programmes were conducted in CSRE with available data. The group is presently working on AMSR-E and SMOS satellite data for soil moisture mapping over large area and also polarimetric SAR data from ALOS-PALSAR and Radarsat-2 for soil moisture retrieval and classification of various land features. The group is involved in collecting ground truth synchronous with TanDEM-X mission and generating high resolution DEM.",

Optical remote sensing data is being used to monitor the retreat of glaciers and mapping of glaciers. Techniques like NDSI are being used to map snow cover. Remote sensing based techniques are evolved to estimate mass balance of different glaciers. For this purpose, AAR and ELA based methods, DEM derived from stereo optical data, SAR interferometry techniques and also from cryosat-2, tandem-x are exploited to evaluate mass balance of various glaciers involving limited field based mass balance measurement values. Algorithms are also being developed based on SAR polarimetry for estimating snow pack characteristics like snow wetness, density, grain size, snow water equivalent etc. Innovative snow cover mapping technique based on polarisation fraction and \u03bb3 (eigen value of coherency matrix) known as radar snow index has also been developed. Differential InSAR techniques are being attempted to estimate the glacier movement. Intensity tracking techniques have been successfully used to understand the glacier movement. A new technique combining ascending and descending track InSAR and multi aperture interferometry together (3D-DInSAR) has been developed to estimate the glacier dynamics.\nGroup Leader: Prof. Gulab Singh (http://www.csre.iitb.ac.in/gulab/)\nFormer Group Leader: Prof. G.

Remote sensing information\nhelps monitor these processes at global as well as regional scales. The\neco-hydrology group at CSRE focuses on two aspects. First is the\ndevelopment perspective, wherein we develop algorithms to estimate\nhydrological variables from satellite information. Currently, the\nemphasis is laid on passive microwave remote sensing of soil moisture,\nwhich quantifies the water content in the unsaturated soil. We are also\ntrying to understand the ability of passive microwave sensors to assess\nthe vegetation dynamics, which can be useful for monitoring droughts and\nagriculture, among other applications. Dedicated operational soil\nmoisture missions, NASA's SMAP, and ESA's SMOS are the primary sources\nof information for our research. The overarching goal of our attempts is\nto improve the accuracy of products over data-sparse countries like\nIndia.\nThe presence of soil moisture at the land-atmosphere interface makes it\nresponsible for partitioning water into evaporation and runoff. India is\namong the hotspots of strong coupling between soil moisture and\nprecipitation. Our group works on assessing the role of soil moisture in\nland-atmosphere interactions using satellite data over India. This\nresearch is challenged by heterogeneous agriculture practices\n(irrigation and cropping patterns) and land cover systems existing in\nIndia. Furthermore, we also work on modeling droughts with an\ninclination towards understanding the anatomy of agricultural droughts\nin India.\nGroup Leader: Prof. Karthikeyan Lanka (https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=olsbxlMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)\nGroup Members:\nPh.D. Students (#phd9)\nM.Tech.

We investigate the cases in which mixed integer convex optimization problems have an exact penalty representation using sharp augmenting functions (norms as augmenting penalty functions). We present a generalizable constructive proof technique for proving existence of exact penalty representations for mixed integer convex programs under specific conditions using the associated value functions. This generalizes the recent results for MILP (Feizollahi, Ahmed and Sun, 2017) and MIQP (Gu, Ahmed and Dey 2020) whilst also providing an alternative proof for the aforementioned along with quantification of the finite penalty parameter in these cases.\nExact augmented Lagrangian duality for mixed integer convex optimization.

    "doc": "Unsupervised Early Exit in DNNs with Multiple Exits\nDeep Neural Networks (DNNs) are generally designed as sequentially cascaded differentiable blocks/layers with a prediction module connected only to its last layer. DNNs can be attached with prediction modules at multiple points along the backbone where inference can stop at an intermediary stage without passing through all the modules. The last exit point may offer a better prediction error but also involves more computational resources and latency. An exit point that is `optimal' in terms of both prediction error and cost is desirable. The optimal exit point may depend on the latent distribution of the tasks and may change from one task type to another. During neural inference, the ground truth of instances may not be available and error rates at each exit point cannot be estimated. Hence one is faced with the problem of selecting the optimal exit in an unsupervised setting. Prior works tackled this problem in an offline supervised setting assuming that enough labeled data is available to estimate the error rate at each exit point and tune the parameters for better accuracy. However, pre-trained DNNs are often deployed in new domains for which a large amount of ground truth may not be available. We model the problem of exit selection as an unsupervised online learning problem and use bandit theory to identify the optimal exit point. Specifically, we focus on Elastic BERT, a pre-trained multi-exit DNN to demonstrate that it `nearly' satisfies the Strong Dominance (SD) property making it possible to learn the optimal exit in an online setup without knowing the ground truth labels. We develop upper confidence bound (UCB) based algorithm named UEE-UCB that provably achieves sub-linear regret under the SD property. Thus our method provides a means to adaptively learn domain-specific optimal exit points in multi-exit DNNs. We empirically validate our algorithm on IMDb and Yelp datasets.",

Submodular and supermodular knapsack sets arise naturally when modeling utilities, risk and probabilistic constraints on discrete variables. In a recent paper Atamt&uumlrk and Narayanan study the lower level set of a non-decreasing submodular function. In this complementary paper we describe pack inequalities for the supermodular covering knapsack set and investigate their separation, extensions and lifting. We give sequence-independent upper bounds and lower bounds on the lifting coefficients. Furthermore, we present a computational study on using the polyhedral results derived for solving 0-1 optimization problems over conic quadratic constraints with a branch-and-cut algorithm.\nSupermodular Covering Knapsack Polytope.

In this paper we investigate the problem of recognizing when a spectrahedron is polyhedral. We generalize and strengthen results of Ramana (1998) regarding the structure of spectrahedra and we devise a normal form of representations of spectrahedra. This normal form is effectively computable and leads to an algorithm for deciding polyhedrality. Our investigation was originally motivated by that if a spectrahedron can be recognized to be a polyhedron then the corresponding semidefinite program can be modeled as a linear program and solved rather efficiently. As Ramana (1998) describes, another motivation lies in connections between spectrahedra and perfect graph theory.\nDeciding Polyhedrality of Spectrahedra.

To handle the exponentially-many probabilistic constraints a separation procedure that solves a nonlinear minimum cut problem is introduced. For the case with independent arc capacities, we exploit the supermodularity of the set function defining the constraints and generate cutting planes based on the supermodular covering knapsack polytope. For the general correlated case, we give a reformulation of the constraints that allows to uncover and utilize the submodularity of a related function. The computational results indicate that exploiting the underlying submodularity and supermodularity arising with the probabilistic constraints provides significant advantages over the classical approaches.\nNetwork Design with Probabilistic Capacities.

To this end, I will suggest what I think are fruitful directions, themes or families of questions, recommend reading, and offer guidance on coming up with your own problems. I prefer to motivate students to explore the unknown rather than offer them an assigned question that I already know the answer to. This is, in my humble opinion, the essence of learning and research! Learning how to find and pose good problems will prepare you well for the future (even if you don't spend your life in academia!) Everyone is indeed different, and you should seek an advisor who's advising style matches your learning style. What seems inspiring and helpful for one student may seem boring or too structured (or too unstructured!) for another.

Gadre\nDepartment of Electrical Engineering\nResearch Interests: Data Analytics, Image processing and analytics (including satellite and medical image processing), Mathematics, Statistics, and Foundations, I work primarily in multiresolution signal and image processing, wavelets, multirate filter banks, time frequency methods and allied subjects. Several years ago, I had initiated work with some of my PhD students in unifying wavelets, multiresolution techniques and neural networks. A couple of PhD Theses supervised by me relate to that theme. With the advent of deep learning/ machine learning, my interest would be to look for unifications of wavelets/ multiresolution methods with deep learning to extrapolate that line of thought and work.

My research group's problems are mainly drawn from the areas of Microfluidics and Turbulent flows. Among our research interests are: development of innovative microdevices for various applications; theoretical development of higher-order continuum transport equations and related experiments; synthetic jet and microchannel based cooling of electronic devices; wake interaction from multiple bodies; etc. We have developed a microdevice for blood-plasma separation; also microdevices for three-dimensional hydrodynamic focusing, and for maintaining constant wall temperature. We have provided the first analytical solution of the Burnett equation (a higher-order continuum transport equation), for any configuration. Further, keeping the limitations of Burnett and Grad equations in mind, we derived a new set of Onsager-consistent equations, which are supposedly more general continuum transport equations then the Navier-Stokes equations. We have demonstrated synthetic jet and microchannel based device for cooling of electronic devices requiring small working distance and input power. Our research work is documented in over 125 journal articles. The work has appeared on the cover page of prestigious journals such as the Journal of Fluid Mechanics and highlighted in the media. The work has been conducted by 13 PhD and 50 MTech students (who are all well placed in various Industry/Academia), along with 4 Postdoctoral Fellows. Currently, I have an active research group comprising several very dedicated students, postdocs and project staff. I am serving as the Editor of Experimental Thermal and Fluid Science and Sadhana; also as Editorial Board Member of Nature Scientific Reports along with two other journals.",

The main goal of this project is to understand the physical phenomenon of materials for neuromorphic computing/machine learning applications, which evokes an extensive interest in the condensed matter physics and engineering disciplines. In this study: (a) multi-component oxide thin films and metal electrodes are grown in non-stoichiometry growth chambers (physical vapour deposition); (b) utilizing them, neuromorphic devices are fabricated in the class 10 cleanroom at the Birck Nanotechnology Center, Purdue University, USA; (c) finally, the devices are characterised in the in-house (controlled environment) high-speed impedance measurement system that is capable of measuring the electrical properties of neuromorphic devices in a time scale of nanoseconds (ns).\nWestern Digital Corporation (Jan 2018 - Sep 2019):\nI was involved in developing 96 layers of three-dimensional (3D) BiCS4-NAND flash memory technology.

In the initial stages of my integrated PhD program (Master of Science (MS) + Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)), I worked on dielectric-made two-terminal memory devices using colloidal nanocrystals. Thereafter, I developed a new electrical measurement technique for two-terminal capacitive flash memory devices. To the best of my knowledge, it is the fastest measurement technique compared to all previously-employed measurement systems for such devices. The above devices were fabricated using a fully solution processing method. This is the first-ever report on fully solution-processed memory devices. In addition, I have fabricated a novel and robust flash memory-TFT using sol-gel dielectrics (ALPO, ZrO2, TiO2 and HfO2) and semiconductors (IGZO, IZO, In2O3 and ZnO2). This type of novel memory technology has not been reported so far due to limitations and optimization of the leakage current and intrinsic trap density simultaneously in the charge storage dielectric layers.
