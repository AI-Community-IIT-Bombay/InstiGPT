Standard inverted research grade microscopes can yield valuable results if you are imaging adherent cells, large regions of interest (such as organelles) or very thin tissue sections (less than 5 micrometer). In widefield, a CCD camera is usually used to capture images and the epi- fluorescence illumination source can be a mercury lamp, xenon lamp, LED\u2019s, etc. Each of light sources require carefully matched interference filters for specific excitation and emission wavelengths of your fluorophore of interest. With widefield microscopy, your specimen is only exposed to excitation light for relatively short time periods as the full aperture of emission light is collected by the objectives. Widefield fluorescence microscopy can be used in combination with other common contrast techniques such as phase contrast and differential interference contract (DIC) microscopy. This combination is useful when performing live-cell imaging to examine general cell morphology or viability while also imaging regions of interest within cells. CLSM has ability to eliminate out-of-focus light and information. It is also possible to obtain optical serial sections from thicker specimens. A conjugate pinhole in optical path of confocal microscope prevents fluorescence from outside of focal plane from being collected by photomultiplier detector or imaged by camera. In CLSM, a single pinhole (and single focused laser spot) is scanned across specimen by scanning system. This spot forms a reflected epi- fluorescence image back on original pinhole. When specimen is in focus, fluorescent light from it passes through pinhole to detector. Any out-of-focus light is defocused at pinhole and very little of this signal passes through to detector meaning that background fluorescence is greatly reduced. The pinhole acts as a spatial filter for emission light from the specimen. This method utilises a \u2018Nipkow Disc\u2019 which is a mechanical opaque disc which has a series of thousands of drilled or etched pinholes arranged in a spiral pattern. Each illuminated pinhole on disc is imaged by microscope objective to a diffraction-limited spot on region of interest on specimen. The emission from fluorophores passes back though Nipkow disc pinholes and can be observed and captured by a CCD camera. The effect of spinning disc is that many thousands of points on specimen are simultaneously illuminated. Using SDCM to examine a specimen means that real-time imaging (30-frames-per-second or faster) can be achieved, which is extremely useful if you are looking at dynamic changes within living cells over a wide spectrum of time-scales. This method enables one to perform live-cell imaging on whole embryos, tissues and cell spheroids in vivo in a gentle manner with high temporal resolution and in three dimensions. One is able to track cell movement over extended periods of time and follow development of organs and tissues on a cellular level. The next evolution of light-sheet fluorescence microscopy, termed lattice light-sheet microscopy as developed by Eric Betzig (Nobel Prize Laureate 2014 for PALM super-resolution microscopy) will even allow live-cell imaging with super-resolved in vivo cellular localization capabilities.

For example, self-driven vehicles use ML components, wrong decisions by which can lead to fatal accidents. The ACAS Xu system for collision avoidance of autonomous drones is another such example, where a neural network is required to satisfy properties rigorously specified in logic. Formal robustness guarantees of image classification networks require the class label to not change until the image is perturbed beyond an acceptable threshold. For various historical reasons, mainstream ML research has focused on development of an extremely rich set of tools, techiniques and models that can be used to perform extremely well in most scenarios, without formal guarantees in all possible corner cases. In this course, we will be primarily interested in the behaviour of ML components in these hard-to-fish-out corner case scenarious. We will study how techniques from formal methods (FM) can be used to provide rigorous guarantees of the behaviour of ML components like deep neural networks (DNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN). Formal methods have been successfully used to provide rigorous guarantees for hardware and software systems in the past, related work leading to at least three Turing Awards. The application of FM to prove properties of modern ML components, however, presents new challenges due to the scale and size of these ML components, and also because of the specifics of their operation. Over the last decade, this has spurred a lot of interest from both the ML and FM research communities, and formal methods for machine learning is now a routine track in most ML/FM conferences. This course will primarily focus on four threads of research in this area: (i) use of abstraction refinement for analyzing DNNs, (ii) use of specialized constraint solving techniques for reasoning about DNNs, (iii) automata theoretic analysis of RNNs, and (iv) formal methods for explainability and robustness of ML components. The course should be useful for students of both formal methods and machine learning, and lies at the intersection of these areas.", "credits": 6, "semester": [{"year": 2023, "season": "autumn", "timetable": []}, {"year": 2023, "season": "spring", "timetable": []}], "tags": ["Theory", "Elective", "Honor"]}}, {"doc": {"code": "CS621", "title": "Artificial Intelligence", "department": {"name": "Computer Science and Engineering", "slug": "computer-science-and-engineering"}, "description": "Prerequisites: Undergraduate Course on Artificial Intelligence Knowledge Representation: The First Order Predicate Logic, Production Systems, Semantic Nets, Frames and Scripts Formalisms.

Continuous and Discrete Optimization are two important pillars of machine learning. Continuous optimization typically occurs in learning model parameters while discrete optimization problems appear in inference and auxiliary tasks such as feature selection, data subset selection, model compression etc. In the first part of this course, we will cover continuous optimization with applications in machine learning. Topics to discuss will include Convexity, Gradient Methods, Proximal algorithms, Stochastic and Online Variants of mentioned methods, Coordinate Descent Methods, Subgradient Methods, Non-Convex Optimization, FrankWolfe, Accelerated Methods, Lagrange and Fenchel Duality, Second-Order Methods, Quasi-Newton Methods, Gradient-Free and Zero-Order Optimization. We will also cover some advanced topics including non-convex optimization, alternating minimization algorithms and parallel/distributed variants of algorithms. We will ground all these algorithms with applications and loss functions in machine learning (starting from logistic regression, linear regression, svms, matrix factorization right up to deep neural networks). Summarily,in Continuous Optimization we will cover topics such as Basics of Continuous Optimization, Convexity, Gradient Descent, Projected/Proximal GD, Subgradient Descent, Accelerated Gradient Descent, Newton & Quasi Newton, Duality: Legrange, Fenchel, Coordinate Descent, Frank Wolfe, Continuous Optimization in Practice, etc. The second part of this course will cover the fundamentals of discrete optimization. We will start with basic forms of combinatorial optimization (knapsack, s-t cuts/paths, matchings and matroids) and then discuss submodular functions and their applications. We will cover algorithms for submodular minimization and maximization under various combinatorial constraints. We will also discuss discrete probabilistic models such as Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs). We will ground all these algorithmic and theoretical results with real world applications in feature selection, summarization and diversified search, structured prediction, data subset selection and model compression. Summarily, in Discrete Optimization we will cover topics such as Linear Cost Problems with Applications in ML, Matroids, Spanning Trees, s-t paths, s-t cuts, Matchings, Covers (Set Covers, Vertex Covers, Edge Covers), Non-Linear Discrete Optimization, Submodular Functions and Applications in Machine Learning, Submodularity and Convexity, Submodular Minimization, Submodular Maximization, Beyond Minimization and Maximization: Other forms of Submodular Optimization, Discrete Optimization in Practice", "credits": 6, "semester": [{"year": 2023, "season": "autumn", "timetable": []}, {"year": 2023, "season": "spring", "timetable": [{"id": 3181, "created_by": "bd6806b6-2cdb-455d-a873-67b4f4f12157", "course": "CS769", "division": "Core", "lecture_slots": ["9A", "9B"], "tutorial_slots": [], "lecture_venue": "CC 103", "professor": "G.Ramakrishnan"}]}], "tags": ["Theory"]}}, {"doc": {"code": "CS770", "title": "Process Engineering", "department": {"name": "Computer Science and Engineering", "slug": "computer-science-and-engineering"}, "description": "(1) Business process Models in OMG\u2019s BPMN business processes, tasks, gateways, pools, lanes, collaborations, public and private processes, choreographies, markers, conversations, ad-hoc models, activities, events, start/end/intermediate events, boundary events, event-driven models, exception paths,subprocesses. 2) Formal Modeling and analytics Places and transitions, tokens and markings, classical Petri Nets, Extended petri nets, Colored petri nets, state spaces, reachability graphs, traces, properties of nets.

With the commercial launch of the Fifth Generation of Mobile Radio Networks (5G) in 2020, antenna engineers need more than ever to be aware of physical layer strategies that are currently considered to reach the expected performance. With techniques such as MIMO and millimeter-wave communications, new challenges arise and antenna engineers cannot afford anymore to be only expert in electromagnetics, but do also require skills regarding propagation channel, digital modulations, and coding aspects. New communications schemes use advanced signal processing and coding techniques in order to exploit as much as possible the propagation channel to maximize some metrics such as the capacity. The antenna being a part of the channel, its properties influence the overall performance, and knowledge of physical layer features is therefore of utmost importance in the antenna design. This course addresses important theoretical concepts in the field of antennas and propagation in the context of 5G communications. The first unit of the course introduces physical layer aspects that have to be considered while designing antenna solutions. The second unit tackles MIMO aspects and how antenna performance should be specifically assessed accordingly. The third unit illustrates some specific issues related to vehicular and ehealth applications. The fourth unit introduces the challenges faced while using millimeterwaves for communications. This unit IV also addresses in detail two advanced antenna technologies, namely, leaky-wave antennas and Substrate-Integrated-Waveguide-based antennas. It is to be noted that theoretical concept in this course are not limited to 5G communications and are therefore useful to any antenna engineer.", "credits": 6, "semester": [{"year": 2023, "season": "autumn", "timetable": []}, {"year": 2023, "season": "spring", "timetable": []}], "tags": ["Theory"]}}, {"doc": {"code": "EE800", "title": "High Speed Interconnects: Signaling and Synchronization", "department": {"name": "Electrical Engineering", "slug": "electrical-engineering"}, "description": "I.Transmission linesa) Lossless/lossy transmission lines.b) S-parameters, impedance matching.c) Pulse propagation in transmission lines.d) Even mode, odd mode (coupled/differential transmission lines).II.

Meta- learning and few-shot learning Zero-shot learning Self-supervised learning Multi-modal learning Multi-task learning Continual learning Domain adaptation and generalization Uncertainty estimation in deep learning We will consider the application of the aforementioned learning algorithms for visual inference tasks with focus to image classification and semantic segmentation. To this end, land-cover classification from remote sensing images of varied modalities would be the running application example that will be discussed at length for all the algorithms. In addition, we will consider a few challenging classification problems in remote sensing (cross-sensor data retrieval, change detection, and land cover map generation for geographically disjoint and large areas) and show how some of these learning techniques (domain adaptation, uncertainty estimate) can be modified to solve these problems. Finally, annotation is a major problem in remote sensing, we plan to discuss how off-the-shelves self-supervision can be used as an alternative in this regard. Like the examples from the remote sensing area, we will consider examples from natural image and video analysis literature concerning very large-scale datasets (ImageNet, DomainNet, to name a few).", "credits": 6, "semester": [{"year": 2023, "season": "autumn", "timetable": [{"id": 4660, "created_by": "bd6806b6-2cdb-455d-a873-67b4f4f12157", "course": "GNR650", "division": "Core", "lecture_slots": ["15A", "15B"], "tutorial_slots": [], "lecture_venue": "LT 002", "professor": "Biplab Banerjee"}]}, {"year": 2023, "season": "spring", "timetable": []}], "tags": []}}, {"doc": {"code": "GNR651", "title": "Digital Photogrammetry and Cartography", "department": {"name": "Centre of Studies in Resources Engineering", "slug": "centre-of-studies-in-resources-engineering"}, "description": ".Principles of analog and analytical photogrammetry, Modelling the geometry of imaging systems, History and evolution of 2D and 3D imaging systems on Indian and foreign satellites Epi-polar registration of stereo images, Orbit attitude modeling using ground control points and Rational Polynomial techniques.

Learning is an important aspect of life. Every living being learns to survive. As Charles Darwin hypothesized about the existence of various species in the world that a living being struggles to exist. And whoever is biologically fit will exists otherwise would perish from the world. Following this Karl Popper, one of the eminent philosophers of science advocates evolutionary epistemology. Learning defined in the theoretical framework of evolutionary epistemology shows the knowledge acquisition happens due to certain biological disposition. The biological need of life explains the necessity of knowledge. Learning therefore remains a continuous activity. One continues to learn in order to remain in the world. So the notion of survival or enduring life goes along with seeking information and bringing change in accord with the information of one\u2019s own well being. The enduring life here refers to an active life where the being participates in the world for its well being. Human life is such that the act of knowledge seeking, which Aristotle defines as the desire to know is something very primitive. It is not merely part of human biological history but also significant for understanding the cultural history. The biological history of human life is significant as it has helped us developing our food habits and medicine. The cultural history tells us understanding the development of values in general and institutions and institutional values in particular. The development of culture is significant because human life is not merely confined to certain biological activities. Rather human life transcends the limit of biological existence. This transcendence is embedded in the very attitude of knowledge seeking \u2013 learning. Learning pervades both the biological forms of life as well as the cultural forms of life. Interestingly the well being of human life requires both that is the biological fitness and the cultural elegance. In this course, we study philosophical ideas of Plato, Aristotle, Jacque Rousseau, John Dewey, Maria Montessori, Nel Nodding, Paulo Freire, Mahatma Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore, Sri Aurobindo and Jiddu Krishnamurthi.

Yet there are profound differences in the larger cultural context for ethical decision-making. As international collaborations become more common, new generations of scholars enter the field of research, and norms and consequences of research become more complicated, these differences need to be more fully confronted. Standard guidelines on responsible conduct of research or IPR / Copyright rules tend to ignore cross-cultural challenges of ethical decision-making in the scientific endeavor, and also ignore alternate perspectives and approaches to such issues. Moving away from norms that are largely proscriptive, field- and country-specific, and from guidelines and approaches to ethical issues that are universalizing, or based on fundamentally western notions of individual intellectual property rights rather than collaborative values, this course places emphasis upon cultural context and upon partnership with international scholars and diverse community groups in developing a new kind of training in scholarly integrity. Through discussing a range of topics from science and engineering especially related to issues of development and change, the course aims to develop skills related to decisions making in the scientific endeavour \u2013 from issues of methodology and development paradigms, to issues of responsibility, informed consent, intellectual property rights, commons, natural resources, livelihoods, sustainability, participation, and scientific and engineering ethics codes. Case studies from real life will be used as tools for class room based workshops on ethical decision making in different scientific arenas. Contentious issues from areas such as biotechnology, civil engineering, water resources management, IPRs/creative commons, and environmental risks will form the core of issues around which teaching will be organized. Topics to be covered1. Introduction: What is ethics? What is morality? What is responsibility?2. Methodology, Epistemology and Ethics: Positivism and its critiques, nature of data, qualitative vs quantitative research3. Thinking about Development: choices and paradigms4. Intellectual Property and Property Rights; Open Access and Creative Commons5. Cultural Competence, Cultural Humility and Participatory Research6.

As a result, the course, while allowing for conversations across time, will take the route of thinking in linear time to examine developments of thought regarding literature. In doing so, the limits of such linear imagination would also be exposed. It will take the crystallisation of \u2018Literature\u2019 as an autonomous domain as the ground to examine how a canon was formed over time. Possible modules listed below. \uf0b7 What is Literature? Historical formation of an autonomous domain for disciplinary and critical consideration; \u2018critique\u2019 and \u2018imagination\u2019 in determination of the human subject, beginning with the philosophical writings of Immanuel Kant and made central by the literary critical efforts by the Romantics; traditions in organising criticism/theory including chronological, or based on ideological or historical co-incidences; thinking with and through enduring debates, \"schools\", convergences \uf0b7 Aesthetics and Ethics Theories of art making in antiquity with an attention to writings in the Greek, Perso-Arabic and Sanskrit traditions, focusing of different conceptual and classificatory practices \uf0b7 Authors, Genres, Traditions Career of the concept of the author, genre and literary traditions, ranging from Samuel Johnson\u2019s Lives of the Poets, author-centric critical practices and concepts such as \u201cintentional fallacy,\u201d and re-consideration of the author figure; development of canons around authors and literary traditions modelled by and around Mathew Arnold and TS Eliot among, others; the emergence of the \u2018lyric\u2019 and later the novel as units of analysis in the context of debates around \u201cliterary fact\u201d (Mary Poovey) \uf0b7 Language, Form and Close Reading Centralisation of the practice of language as constituting the central thematic for literary criticism/theory, with the emergence of \u2018New Criticism\u2019, \u2018Practical Criticism\u2019 and Russian Formalism, and structuralist linguistics and anthropology on the other hand; further development of and response to these debates by scholars of post-structuralist and narratological persuasions \uf0b7 The Material Foundations of Literature Critical thinking that framed literature in relation to material and infrastructural foundations through Marxism and psychoanalysis; \u201chermeneutics of suspicion\u201d (Paul Ricouer) \uf0b7 What Literature? Challenges to the boundary-making practices ingrained in the concept of literature as it emerged in the Anglo-American tradition of literary criticism /theory; shifts occasioned by political impulses and/or geo-political considerations: challenges from Feminist theory, race theory, postcolonial theory, or theories and reading practices grappling with issues of sexuality, ethnicity and caste; translation and the emergence of the discipline of Comparative Literature and the field of \u2018World Literature\u2019 \uf0b7 Literature and other fields/disciplines The question of autonomy of literature and its relationship with other fields and disciplines: relationship of literature with disciplines such as history, anthropology and sociology, which has been theorised extensively, and the natural sciences (especially with a focus on the environment), medicine and the law, more recently; the exchanges between the literary and the popular \uf0b7 Post-critique The \u201cpost-critical\u201d (from the late 1990s and as loosely called): return to the history of the formation of the discipline and its assumptions, in face of the challenges that the discipline faced as discussed in the previous module, such as how literature came to be imagined as providing knowledge and attempts to re-state the salience of the \u2018literature\u2019; historicisation of literary criticism as a dynamic space that needs re-imagination and re-invention; methodologies developed in light of the digital turn or re-animation of newer textual reading practices", "credits": 6, "semester": [{"year": 2023, "season": "autumn", "timetable": []}, {"year": 2023, "season": "spring", "timetable": [{"id": 4147, "created_by": "bd6806b6-2cdb-455d-a873-67b4f4f12157", "course": "HS658", "division": "Core", "lecture_slots": ["11B"], "tutorial_slots": [], "lecture_venue": "LT 104", "professor": "Suddhaseel Sen"}]}], "tags": []}}, {"doc": {"code": "HS659", "title": "Shakespeare`s Plays and their Afterlives", "department": {"name": "Humanities and Social Sciences", "slug": "humanities-and-social-sciences"}, "description": "\uf0b7 Topics will include an overview of Shakespearean theatre, audience, classification of his plays, and the main corpus of significant Shakespearean criticism down the centuries.

To take a few examples: \uf0b7 Shakespeare`s Scottish play will be read in sufficient detail and re-considered in the light of its afterlives. These afterlives could span a wide linguistic and cultural range, from Orson Welles` Voodoo Macbeth and Roman Polanski`s The Tragedy of Macbeth to Akira Kurosawa`s Throne of Blood and Vishal Bharadwaj`s Maqbool. \uf0b7 Similarly, an early comedy like A Midsummer Night`s Dream could be read alongside Neil Gaiman`s graphic novel \"A Midsummer Night`s Dream\" and Habib Tanvir`s Chhattisgarhi recreation Kamdev ka Apna, Basant Ritu ka Sapna; or a later and mature comedy like Twelfth Night read alongside Atul Kumar`s Piya Behrupiya. \uf0b7 A significant objective of this reading is for comparative analysis, as well as an understanding of how themes and techniques come to be modified and re-envisioned, not just across cultural contexts but also genres and media, like the graphic novel and film. Questions arising from these correspondences and ranging from the generic to the specific, will find special place in this course: a) How does a pre-eminently visual medium such as Neil Gaiman\u2019s graphic-novel version of A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream speak to a play, whose language was seen as a competent substitute for visual accessories including stage props? b) How, to what extent and towards what intent do Shakespearean rewritings exploit the formulaic nature of his plays? c) What interpretative dimension has technology added to reinventions? d) What is the readership/audience projected by the afterlives? e) How do the plays and their afterlives negotiate with literary, technical and political self-reflexivity?

While the course`s foundation lies in the tools of probability, statistics and quantitative methods, we will strive to help understand the strengths (and weaknesses) of using quantitative information (data), as well as develop frameworks and mindset to both utilize and question the kinds of analytics they may encounter from the executive vantage point. It will also guide them in what kinds of analytics they should be asking for, given the current state of modern data science and methodology. This course uses case studies when appropriate. We will employ situational examples in which critical decisions are made in the face of uncertainty and analytics are deployed to shed light on key issues and relationships. We will examine situations that require the filtering and processing of available data, as well as circumstances that force the use of judicious assumptions and \u201cwhat-if\u201d analyses. The operating assumption of this course is that the quality (and performance) of business choices and actions will improve unambiguously if senior managers: \u2022 Get/filter/distill the information that matters most and ask critical and skeptical questions \u2022 Interpret and convert analytical outputs into knowledge \u2022 Reduce uncertainty and apply analytics to bolster judgment The circumstances to which the above three steps can apply are broad. Moreover, the thinking process developed is generalizable to areas beyond business management. The objectives of this course are to: A. Provide for students a relevant and usable toolkit to improve comprehension of business problems B. Engage and drive student interest in making analytically sound decisions C. Provide tools that will serve them both in furthering their careers", "credits": 2, "semester": [{"year": 2023, "season": "autumn", "timetable": []}, {"year": 2023, "season": "spring", "timetable": []}], "tags": ["Theory"]}}, {"doc": {"code": "MA001", "title": "Preparatory Mathematics I", "department": {"name": "Mathematics", "slug": "mathematics"}, "description": "Complex numbers as ordered paris.

There are two main components of this course; written communication and verbal communication. For the written part, the student will learn a typesetting language, like LaTex, and demonstrate her/his skills by preparing a written report on a topic of her/his own choice. Out of the six main areas represented in the department, the student will choose an area. Then the student will choose a topic in this area of current interest in consultation with a faculty. The student will then find recent articles on the topic using internet resources like MathSciNet, Google Scholar, etc. and the library. The student is expected to write a summary of these articles and prepare a report. Learning LaTex, choice of a topic and finding relevant material on the internet should be completed by the mid-semester examination. After that the student will write the report in not more than three weeks time. It is important that a student does not plagiarise while writing this report. This should be informed by the instructor to all the students at the beginning of the course. For the verbal part, the student will choose another area represented in the department, different from the one chosen for the written part. In this area, the student will choose a topic of general interest and will give a presentation of up to two hours on the chosen topic. After the mid-semester examination is over, the student will start thinking about the topic for verbal presentation, prepare the presentation in about three-four weeks and deliver it in the last two weeks of the semester. As an example, if a student chooses the topic of differential equations for her written communication project, a possible choice of topic may be the Navier-Stokes equations (in dimension 2 perhaps) and she will write a report stating the interest in the equations due to their describing various physical phenomena, a bit of history and recent results proving the existence and smoothness of the solutions. If, for the verbal part, the student now chooses functional analysis, she may choose the celebrated Gelfand-Naimark theorem (perhaps for commutative C*-algebras) and give two lectures on it.

Evolutionary perspectives in geology, biology and society.

Since a significant section of mechanical engineering deals with generation of power, and almost the entirety of this power is generated by means of techniques that deal with transferring energy from some form to another form, thermal and fluids engineering plays a significant role. Besides the generation of power, most systems from mechanical engineering have to deal with either absorption or dissipation of heat, and with some or other form of fluids. Hence, the principles learnt in this stream are useful throughout the entire domain of mechanical engineering. \uf0b7Overview of Design engineering: The design stream deals with the conceptualization of the machine that needs to be produced. The process begins with a thorough assessment of the need of such a machine. Once the necessities are clearly ascertained, the design process in initiated involving various methodologies of analysis, such as stress analysis, thermal analysis, analysis of the kinematics and dynamics of the machine including the transfer of motion and power, an analysis of manufacturability, etc. The analysis is conducted on both the machine as a composite unit as well as its components. Finally, the drawings of the manufacturable design are created and passed on to the engineers specializing in the manufacturing stream. \uf0b7Overview of Manufacturing engineering: The manufacturing stream is involved with the manufacturing of components for the machines that were designed by the engineers specializing in the design stream. The process begins with identification of the proper raw materials, moves on to the choice of the machines that would be utilized for machining the components, and finally the machining process itself with its associated controls over dimensions and tolerances. Engineers in this stream are constantly attempting to innovate methodologies that allow production of the machines and their components with the best of quality, but with also with least amounts of debris and the least possible cost.", "credits": 6, "semester": [{"year": 2023, "season": "autumn", "timetable": [{"id": 4817, "created_by": "bd6806b6-2cdb-455d-a873-67b4f4f12157", "course": "ME103", "division": "Core", "lecture_slots": ["4A", "4B", "4C"], "tutorial_slots": [], "lecture_venue": "LA 201", "professor": "Neeraj Kumbhakarna, Date P.P."}]}, {"year": 2023, "season": "spring", "timetable": []}], "tags": []}}, {"doc": {"code": "ME104", "title": "Engineering Mechanics", "department": {"name": "Mechanical Engineering", "slug": "mechanical-engineering"}, "description": "Module 1: Introduction to Engineering Mechanics covering, Force Systems Basic concepts, Particle and rigid body equilibrium in 2-D & 3-D; System of Forces, Coplanar Concurrent Forces, Components in Space \u2013 Resultant- Moment of Forces and its Application; Couples and Resultant of Force System, Equilibrium of System of Forces, Free body diagrams, Equations of Equilibrium of Coplanar Systems and Spatial Systems; Static Indeterminancy Module 2: Friction covering, Types of friction, Limiting friction, Laws of Friction, Static and Dynamic Friction; Motion of Bodies, wedge friction; Module 3: Basic Structural Analysis covering, Equilibrium in three dimensions; Simple Trusses; How to determine if a member is in tension or compression; Zero force members; Beams & types of beams; Frames & Machines; Module 4: Virtual Work and Energy Method- Virtual displacements, principle of virtual work for particle and ideal system of rigid bodies, degrees of freedom.

To make writing in general and policy related writing in particular, become a crucial tool for their professional development. 2. To introduce students to the theory and practice of narrative analysis and situated reading as a research methodology for interpreting texts. 3. To strengthen students\u2019 ability to critique and problematise discourses through a critical reading of texts, identify gaps and raise relevant questions of discourses and themes represented within texts as works of art. This course will initiate students into the process of critique, evaluation and interpretation of pervasive discourses through the practice of textual analysis. The following are seven core objectives: Make students fluent in terms of writing and feel intellectually capacitated with Policy related themes. Make \u2018writing\u2019 become a very useful tool on their intellectual shelf. Familiarise students with the nuances of textual interpretation to aid discourse analysis. Introduce students to narratology, deep reading methods and humanities perspectives on discourse analysis. Enable students to think systematically, analytically and critically while interpreting texts through situated reading. Enable students to problematise texts and construct critiques of works, providing evidence for the critique from the text. Reflect on the ways in which textual interpretation in discourse analysis can enhance and deepen qualitative research practices. The topics covered in the course will include relevant contemporary themes from critical and cultural theory like the Anthropocene, construction of spaces, gender, conflict, globalization, diaspora and migration, and identity, among others. Relevant theorists and their works will be used alongside rhetorical works and artefacts like (non)fiction, memoirs, documentaries, films, to debate and construct critiques.

In second module, the course delves into the draft constitution and explores how the Constituent Assembly handled matters related to affirmative action. In third module, it examines the provisions in the Constitution that aim to extend affirmative action. It highlights three distinct ways in which the Constitution sought to achieve this goal. Additionally, it analyzes the Champakam Dorairajan case and the first amendment to the Constitution. In fourth module, the course discusses the report of the Mandal Commission and the Indra Sawhney case. It also explores the Constitutional amendment pertaining to affirmative action in promotion. In fifth module, it focuses on the 73rd and 74th Amendments to the Constitution, which expanded affirmative action by providing reservation of constituencies for women in Panchayati Raj. In sixth module, the course covers subsequent amendments, including notable cases such as Nagraj, Jarnail Singh, and the reservation for economically weaker sections (EWS).

This led to the widespread belief that deterministic controllers, superimposed with optimal state estimators and conventional communi- cation protocols, would be optimal in stochastic environments. Over time, several landmark papers revealed that nothing could be farther from the truth. We realize today that co-design of communication and control offers orders of magnitude of improvements in performance over separate design and that in some cases, it is essential to change the very notion of information for purposes of control. These issues are exacerbated in the control of decentralized systems evolving in random environments. Examples of such systems are smart cities, transportation systems, power grids, gaming and financial markets. This complex subject requires simultaneous application of control theory and communication theory. At present these elements are taught separately in courses designed either exclusively for deterministic control theory, or exclusively for communication theory. This leaves behind a gap, namely blending insights from both disciplines to arrive at approaches for networked control problems. This course seeks to fill this gap. It will begin with traditional, or so called \u201cclassical\u201d stochastic control. Then cover information/communication theory, and finally cover important topics in networked control. A unity between decentralized decision theory, information theory and control theory will be evident by the end of this course. The course will benefit all students interested in stochastic control, communication/information theory, decentralized decision making, and game theory.

The course will require students to carry out one of the protocols and practices already developed in CTARA and to report the outcomes. Examples of such protocols are:(i)Analysis of a piped water supply scheme: This protocol will analyze an existing water supply scheme. The aspects covered will be technical, socio-economic and institutional, such as demand and supply, source and strength of source, simulations of systems, study of pani-samiti and so on. It will involve meeting with all stakeholders, such as beneficiary villages, elected representatives, department engineers etc., and building a document analyzing the scheme as per existing protocols.(ii)Analysis of a jaggery plant: This protocol will analyze the working of an existing jaggery plant. It will measure the technical a well as the socio-economic parameters of the plant. This includes thermal efficiency, feed-stock, packaging, bagasse re-use, operations and so on.The course will begin with training the student in the methodology and tools required to execute the protocol. This may be, e.g., instrumentation, simulation, questionnaire development, documentation etc. This will be followed by the protocol itself. Finally, the outcome of the protocol will be documented and reported in a suggested format to all stakeholders.
