HS207 - Social Psychology,Prof Mrinmoyi Kulkarni,"It has no prerequisites and if one attends the classes regularly, it is pretty easy to follow. It would help if you have an interest in humanities related disciplines and want to explore more.
 It is part of the HSS minor offered by the Humanities and Social Sciences Dept. It usually runs in the autumn semester and can be taken in whichever year youâ€™d like.","During most of the semester, attending classes would suffice, which amounts to 3hrs/week. Assessments (one write up and a paper presentation in a team of 2) can take up some time but can be managed easily if managed properly. Before end-sems and mid-sems, a day or two of revision proved to be enough for me.",There was no attendance policy implemented by the professor as such.,Not for B.Tech students,,"Non-verbal cues, Attitudes, Prejudice, Cognitive Dissonance, Attitudes, Social Psychology and the Law","The professor taught using minimal content on the slides that she explained during the lectures. She very conveniently came up with examples from historic events and everyday happenings that made the classes interactive and interesting.
 The Kurosava movie â€˜Roshomonâ€™ was screened during one lecture to explain the importance of different perspectives on the same event.","Apart from mid-sem and end-sem, there were 2 other assignments:","Midsem: subjective
 Endsem: objective
 Questions asked were from the concepts taught and discussed in class. For preparation, noting key information during lectures was important because the slides didnâ€™t cover the material in detail. Then revising these notes and going through the slides before the exam was enough to secure a good grade.",,,
DE410 - Perspectives on World Cinema,Prof Mazhar Kamran,"2/5, 5 being the most difficult
 A major part of the course was attending the weekly film screening and writing up about it. So, if one has an interest in cinema*, the course would go seamlessly for them.
 It is a part of the design minorâ€™s course basket and can be taken in any year since it is pretty much independent of any other course.","During the course, there was one ~1hr class on Wednesday and a film screening on Friday night. Writing up about the films after watching them was required as part of the assignment but didnâ€™t take too long (an hour or two per film but that might depend).",Attendance during the lectures and screenings wasnâ€™t mandatory but contributed a certain fraction (~20%) to the final grade.,Not for B.Tech students,,"*World Cinema; which includes pretty old films from various countries like Russia, Italy, France, Japan, etc. Some of these may be abstract or a tad boring at times but offer great insight into the characters and the culture theyâ€™re based in.
 During the lectures, the professor discussed about filmmakers from different countries and film-movements across the world. But the discussions also often transitioned into art in general and sometimes about his experiences in filmmaking.
 The course was NOT about filmmaking but rather about learning to watch and appreciate films critically.","The professor, an FTII alum, has worked on landmark Hindi films like Satya (as a cinematographer) and possesses a thorough understanding of world cinema. He discusses the different world cinema filmmakers and their styles during lectures which incites curiosity within the students.
 The discussions with him were always super interesting and enlightening, especially if one is into cinema, art and literature.","Apart from attendance, which accounted for around 20% of the final course total, there were 2 things expected:","There were no mid-sem, end-sem or any other written exams.",,,
CS218 - Design & Analysis of Algorithms,Prof. Paritosh Pandya,Overall the course is moderate. It is recommended to take it in the 3rd/4th year after completing CS213.,"It is recommended to attend all the lectures as Prof. Paritosh is a gem of a teacher. Apart from 3 hrs/week, studying a little bit before the exams should be enough.",No attendance policy was enforced.,Not for B.Tech students,,"Sir used slides in the class which were quite descriptive. The teaching seemed somewhat monotonous, especially in the second half of the course as the topics became theory intensive. A couple of assignments were given and solved by the TAs in class.","Sir used slides in the class which were quite descriptive.

CM801 - Introduction to Risk Analysis,Prof. Subhankar Karnmakar (a very very nice professor - best giveaway for the course!),"Moderate - level 3
 I took up the course in my third year, it didnâ€™t seem too difficult. Probability-based content is taught; it is not too advanced, though.",I only studied for 6-7 hours prior to quizzes; endsem/midsem/project would require more time. Overall 2 hrs a week of consistent studying or even honest last-minute prep is sufficient.,The professor was strict about attendance - approximately 70% is required.,Not for B.Tech students,,Some theory about environmental risk & mathematical models to quantify the same (fuzzy techniques etc.) â€“ easy to moderate level content but there are quite a few topics - so good prep & time would be required.,Very comprehensive slides + the prof. is very open to clearing doubts â€“ most questions for exams are based on the content taught in class.,2 Assignments - pretty chill ChatGPT level; group project is also straightforward - need to review some papers & develop insights on the same,"Exams were quite easy, although one needs to be thorough with the content & hence put in honest effort + time",,,
US607 - Sustainability Assessment of Urban Systems,Prof. Pradip P Kalbar,"Moderate difficulty, requires attention during class to stay on top of everything. Not too tough, however last day preparations can lose you grades",1 hour weekly,No attendance mandatory,Not for B.Tech students,,"Sustainability analysis of cities. Global warming topics, UN SDG and their importance. Then moves on to defining flow analysis of energy, waste and material in cities and ecosystems.",Online: Slides with presentation. Good teaching with proper flow and explanations. Very engaging for people who are interested in the course.

The notes were really good and self-sufficient.,The assignments and tuts were important as the exams were directly based on them,The tests in the start were easy and scoring. As the course progressed they became tougher and took more time to solve. A few of them were very calculative.,No follow-up courses as such but gives a good overview of finance related topics,Prof notes were enough,I took the course in my 4th sem. SI417 is a prerequisite hence it can be taken in any sem after you have completed the course.
SI417 - Introduction to Probability Theory,S.Baskar,Moderate,The lectures had 3 hr worth of content every week. Apart from that tuts were given which took about 2-3 hrs but were optional,"Took this course online. The lectures were pre-recorded so no attendance there, help sessions had optional attendance",This is an introductory course in Statistics hence only JEE stats knowledge is expected,"AA to the highest scorer, absolute grading wrt to highest marks. 40% of the highest marks was the passing criteria","Discrete and continuous probability, Random variables and expectation, Special classes of random variables, Probability theorems and laws etc.","All Pre-recorded lectures, weekly tuts and quizes",The tuts were important as the exams were directly based on them.,10 quizzes of 10 percent each. The quizzes in the start of the semester were very scoring. The content got tougher as the semester passed,,Some NPTL courses from IIT Madras elec department have similar content,"I took the course up in my 3 sem.

SC701 - Physics and Control,Navin Khaneja,"Moderate (with background), Difficult if this is your first course involving Lie Algebra",1-4 hours per week for self-study (beyond lectures) depending on background. Profâ€™s notes are not self-sufficient and need to be supplemented by extra reading.,"There was no attendance policy. In online mode, recorded lectures were uploaded for reference. Prof Khaneja does not enforce attendance policies in offline mode as well.","Officially no prerequisites are mentioned. However, a basic understanding of quantum mechanics (at the level of QM1, not just PH107) is necessary to appreciate the later part of the course. NMR and spin systems are touched upon briefly and donâ€™t need any serious pre-requisite knowledge.
 As this is primarily a course on the intersection of physics & control, many basics are glanced over and a first course in control theory would be quite helpful.","Homework - 1 assignment per chapter - 4 chapters in total - 35%

Lectures are a bit difficult to follow but the material is quite interesting and the pace is easy to keep up with.","The Assignments are provided at the end of the notes from day 1, and we were given plenty of time to solve them. Apart from a few typos and ill-defined questions, they were on the easy to medium side.","No quizzes.
 Midsem/Endsem: The exams were quite easy, including open notes and were usually completed well before time by everyone. If you have solved all the assignments, the exams were straightforward.",Useful to get a flavor of control theory in the context of physics for non-physics students. Also useful for physics students to understand applications of control theory to physics.,"The Prof suggested the following:

 3) M. Goldman, â€œQuantum description of high resolution NMR in liquidsâ€, Oxford
 Univ. Press, 1988",I took the course in my 9th semester (dropped it before endsem due to placements/PhD applications). I would recommend taking it in 3rd or 4th year after doing a basic course that covers Group Theory/Control Systems and QM1. You can take it alongside basic control systems course in 2nd year but understanding the quantum mechanics would become challenging.
SC625 - Systems Theory,Vivek Natarajan,"The course is somewhere between moderate to tough. It involves a lot of proofs, but the prof makes very good notes of the proofs.

PH251 - Classical Mechanics,Archana Pai,This is an entry level course for the Physics Minor. It covers general topics on mechanics and the mathematics related to it that would interest any physics enthusiast. The course curriculum can be diverse but the topics are easy to understand.,Regularly watching the lectures are more than enough for covering the syllabus and scoring well in exams.,The instructor uploads pre-recorded videos and takes doubt sessions once a week.

MM656 - Simulation and Optimisation,Sumit Saxena,"The course is easily one of the most straightforward courses in the department. It mainly teaches you formulating equations and constraints and then using different techniques to solve those equations. The professor is crisp and clear and easy to follow, and the slides used are pretty exhaustive. The pace at which it is taught is very comfortable. All in all, it is very easy to learn and score in this course.",This is not a time heavy course. Paying full attention in class should sufficiently prepare you for the exams.

Reference books are available but unnecessary for the purposes of the course.,Take home assignments are really straightforward and make you practice the concepts learnt in class.,"Scoring marks in exams is really easy. There is no real distinction between midsem, endsem and quizzes. Questions in exams are exactly on the same models that are taught in class.

What I felt during the class was that their entire focus was on teaching us (and not on grading/testing us). The classroom environment was plenty informal and interactive. 
 I felt that their teaching style is such that youâ€™re not really faced with an overwhelming wave of information that leaves you feeling helpless; the professor helps you break down the concepts involved, and they wonâ€™t proceed if youâ€™re not clear on any given concept; so at the end, the â€˜difficultyâ€™ of the course should be a non-issue, because you understand the content if you speak up in class; someone has said that learning is mostly telling and teaching is mostly listening, so do speak up please : ) .","Designed in a way, not to test us, but to facilitate learning.",No exams,-,-,"8th semester (Jan-April 2020, Spring â€˜19-â€˜20).

ME679 - Micromechanics of Composites,Prof. Asim Tewari,"Basic to Intermediate level. All the concepts are taught from scratch, with in-depth calculations done by the Professor in the lecture itself. If the initial lectures are understood carefully by the student, then there should not be much difficulty in understanding the latter topics, which are mostly theoretical.

 Composite material behaviour estimation under a variety of loadings.","We had offline lectures in which all the calculations and theory were discussed by Professor in the class itself. Note-making was an essential aspect of the learning, as there were no slides used by the professor in the class.
 Professorâ€™s teaching style is very adaptive and fun, so the 1.5 hour lecture doesnâ€™t feel like a long duration of time. Doubts were solved in the lecture itself and thus there was a very limited requirement of extra time commitment apart from the lecture itself.","The course had a coding project (to be done individually), with the preferred language being python. It was of an all-encompassing type, i.e., as the lectures progressed, new sub-problems were added to the project. Overall, a nice learning experience.","There were no quizzes. The Midsem and Endsem were open book/notes tests with lenient exam duration.
 Both the exams were very thought provoking and many of the questions asked were from the notes provided by the professor. The grading of the tests was mostly binary, with one getting either 0 or full marks for most of the questions.",,"Micromechanics of defects in solids by T.

A weekly brush-up is enough to get a broader idea how the course is being progressed.,"Although the professor doesnâ€™t check for attendance, it is expected that you give 70% of the attendance because of the random short quizzes. If you are in the class, he expects you to pay full attention and starts asking questions randomly to the attendees.","Not really, the professor covers everything from basics.",The assignments were supposed to be done in groups of 3-4 and carried a weightage of 30%. The quizzes along with some in-class short quizzes (kind of 5 minute surprise quizzes) carried 30% weightage. Mid and end semester exams were given 20% each. It was a bit easier to score as the heavy weightage is not given to single exams like mid or end semester but rather was distributed throughout the semester in the form of quizzes/assignments.,"Course starts with a revision on vector calculus and proceeds towards Linear Algebra with 2-3 new topics like eigenvalues, diagonalization and least squares fit of data apart from the topics covered in first year Linear Algebra course. Later into the semester, we encounter ODEs, Sturm-Liouville Boundary Value Problems, Partial Differential Equations and integral transforms (Fourier Sine and Cosine, Laplace transforms, etc.).",Professor Karagadde writes notes live while teaching in the class and uploads the recorded videos and hand-written digital notes. He covers all the topics from basics so that no one feels difficulty in catching up.,"There are very frequent assignments. Sometimes it feels too hectic and also difficult to solve. But since the assignments are to be submitted in groups, the final time commitment we feel towards the end is not much.","Quizzes are almost straight forward ones based on the methods that sir teaches. For mid and end semester exams, sir might give questions based on some different techniques that he narrates in the class but not write in the notes.","To stay in the engineering field, the techniques taught in the course will be of great importance for any course that involves some math and going towards research.",,I took the course in my 9th semester.

ME661 - Advanced Thermodynamics & Combustion,Sandip Kumar Saha,"The course begins from basic topics in thermodynamics and extends to more difficult ones (e.g. Fugacity). The lecture videos should be viewed diligently, or else one might miss some key concepts. The lecture videos themselves are not extensive, thus for problem-solving, one has to pursue other means, such as YouTube videos, previous year GATE papers, etc. Way too many platforms (Google Meet, Webex, SAFE, Codetantra, Moodle) were used to take exams, which might lead to some confusion.

Second half time commitment varies depending on the project undertaken.,Compulsory attendance else grade penalty may or may not be imposed.,None,50% for best of 5 out of 6 quizzes and 50% for project,The course provides the critical tools to get started with product design and automation of manufacturing. Students will be expected to work on hands on real life project and may have to visit industries as well.,The first half of quizzes is mostly self study and focuses on a quiz per week to quickly get the students acquainted with course content then followed by second half which is completely focused on project that involves applying the theory learned earlier.,Quizzes are quite easy but require a lot of reading and memorizing since there are a lot of things to learn rather than solve. The project are quite hands on and requires meeting up with Prof Karunakaran twice a week to ensure that actual work is being done. The instructor is very much passionate when it comes to the project and will oversee it throughout its entirety.,No endsems and midsems. Quizzes cover most of the topics read and just requires a lot of memory power.

ME601 - Stress Analysis,Prof. Tanmay Bhandarkar,"The course is mathematical in nature and Profâ€™s rigorous teaching makes it moderate to difficult to understand, especially for those who donâ€™t have a background in vector calculus and linear algebra. Although he covers the required background to understand it.",Course would require about 2 to 3 hours per week apart from the lectures.,None in online. Cannot comment about offline semester.,A knowledge in multivariate calculus and linear algebra can be beneficial. Background in solid mechanics can be an added advantage.,,"The course is about fundamental concepts in structural mechanics. It has two parts, continuum mechanics and elasticity. In the first part he covers mathematical preliminaries such as vectors, tensors and multivariate calculus. Using these basics, kinematic equations, balance laws and constitutive equations are covered. In the next section he covers the aspects of linear elasticity, boundary value problems and further torsion.","The instructor covers the course from a very mathematical perspective and hence a grasp on mathematical preliminaries becomes important. He uses lecture slides, which are quite comprehensive in nature. The pace of teaching is appreciable, he makes sure that fundamentals are clear to students.",,"The assignments are heavy and rigorous in nature and involve a lot of proofs. The same goes for exams as well. Since the assignments cover all the important concepts, having spent time on them makes exams easier. However, this depends a lot on the instructor.",,,"I did this course in Autumn 2020. The course usually runs in Autumn semester, otherwise one can take whenever they feel like."
ME460 - Solid State Joining,Prof. Amber Shrivastava,"The course is pretty chill. Concepts are covered from the very basics, and thus, they should be easy to follow. Even if some lectures are missed, one can attend the subsequent lectures and wonâ€™t have much of a hassle understanding the topic. 
 The projects being individual might be a bit difficult at first glance, but little effort throughout the semester certainly helps. Besides, a much out-of-the-box/ novel solution is not expected by the Professor in the first place and one has to just try and replicate the papers provided.
 The quizzes were easy, the questions asked were mostly in line with the preceding assignments. There was no midsem and the endsem had 4 questions, each from one of the 4 conducted quizzes.","Minimal, just attending the lectures should be enough.

Overall, the teaching was good, and the one-hour lecture time surely helped in keeping things interesting.","There were 2 assignments in total. Transient and steady-state boundary problems had to be coded (MATLAB/ Python). A major chunk of the solution was already provided in the lecture slides, so the difficulty level of the assignments could be termed relatively easy.

The concepts were not very hard to understand after referring to the prescribed textbook. There were coding assignments which were to be done in Scilab but sufficient time was given to learn programming in Scilab. A project in Ansys was also a significant part of the course and one would benefit if they knew Ansys Fluent beforehand.,"The theory portion consisted of watching videos uploaded by Prof Atul Sharma every week and one session with the prof for discussion and doubts.

The Midsem and Endsem expected the solutions to be rigorous. Every exam consisted of subjective type of questions in which you had to prove something and all exams were closed book and closed notes.,"The course might be most helpful for the students interested in Computer Science (mostly cryptography) and physical systems where there are symmetries involved, especially in the laws of physics, modeling structures like solid structure or molecular structure in chemistry.

 The prof had great expectations from the project and will require you to put in a great deal of effort in data collecting, curating, pre processing, cleaning etc. He would appreciate original ideas, but thatâ€™s about it, not much help is gained from the professor if youâ€™re stuck. Wonâ€™t be like the UG projects which we usually complete (or start, in some cases) very close to the deadline.","Exams were open books, open notes.

The reference book for this was â€˜Simulationâ€™ by Ross. The book has a set of examples on discrete event simulation and one of them was asked to be coded in MATLAB/Scilab for the midsem.","There was 1 assignment give premidsem, which was very easy. The end-term project is a bit demanding in terms of time. This is because it involves simulation on a software called Anylogic (which takes some time to get accustomed to). However the prof released the topics a bit late owing to which all groups had to struggle to get the project completed on time. Nonetheless the project is definitely rich in terms of learning outcomes.","Weekly Quizzes (premidsem): They were moderately easy, those having completed one course in UG probability will have no problems acing these.",This course is immensely useful in IEOR and for those dealing with massive simulation data outputs.

The contents are easy to follow and it is easy to establish relationships between different topics (i.e. the course wonâ€™t seem to be consisting of many disjoint topics). The course consists of, as the name suggests, mathematical optimisation techniques, and they are quite intuitive. They are not very mathematically rigorous, and are quite easy to understand once you develop an intuition as to why we are using the particular technique. The exams are moderate, and consist of application of the techniques taught to very real life problems. A good score is possible even if you go through the lectures and the notes.

Teams were randomly formed by the professor and were allotted two weeks. The objective of the presentation was to explain and critically analyse the readings, in addition to whatever was discussed over the week.
 Teaching is excellent - at first sight, it may seem that the professor is a bit abstruse and wordy, however once you thoroughly devour the readings and re-watch the lectures, everything begins to make complete sense. Watching lecture videos are extremely recommended as the professorâ€™s way of explaining concepts is out of this world.","Team presentation - the professor is extremely critical and has a very high bar for the presentations, he expects a thorough analytical review of the reading, not a copy of the lecturesof the week, expect a lot of follow-up questions

It starts with a brief history of languages, their evolution in time and their geographical variations. Further, it discussed how children and adults acquire different languages. Then it moves to its scientific part, covering different various speech sounds generated by vocal chords, how they form various patterns giving rise to alphabets, how they lead to formation of words and meaningful sentences that help us to communicate. The course gives a universal perspective about human languages, i.e., not limiting to one particular language.","The instructor delivers lectures using slides and often uses videos for various concepts. The teaching is and she is considerate about studentsâ€™ understanding. She is friendly and encourages students to have discussions and keeps putting interesting questions in front of them. However, sometimes lectures are fast, but one can always ask her to repeat the concepts.","No tutorials and no projects. The four assignments are interesting, where each student works on a language chosen by them. They involve answering some general questions, which again can be factual or can involve some analysis for the chosen language. One will have to do an external research about their language.","The weekly quizzes are doable if one has paid attention to previous weeksâ€™ lectures. They are both factual and involve some analysis, depending on the content of the course. Same goes for the exams. They are not lengthy but involve thinking.

Teams of 6-8 must come up with a start-up idea with a reasonable amount of engineering element and if possible, a widespread impact. Over the course of the semester, they are supposed to design, test and manufacture the product (manufacture wasnâ€™t possible online) and come up with a business case for their product and a pitch deck. The team must then present at a Shark Tank where the other members of the class are the sharks. Teams are effectively left by themselves throughout the semester, although there a bunch of intermediate checkpoints, including report submissions and review meetings. Your final grade in the project is effectively proportional to the investment received in the Shark Tank.",None,"If you have a good tech startup idea, this may be the perfect opportunity to showcase it to the world. The professor has a lot of industry contacts and at times, was willing to push some of the startup ideas in class to actual investors.
 For the others, itâ€™s an extremely unconventional yet fun experience that pushes you out of your comfort zone. And by the end, youâ€™re left with a great set of public speaking, presentation and business skills.",None,

So, 30% of time there would be dead silence in class. He answers doubts in class but tends to get frustrated if you keep asking them. Numerical questions would not be covered much in lectures and most of the focus would be on revision of Mech concepts.","Assignments were of moderate difficulty. Some problems were repetition of last yearâ€™s problems, others were covered in lectures only. Project forms a major portion of the course (50%) so proper time had to be spent each week. We could form team of 4-5 for the project. Generally project requires us to fabricate a product with some of our own inventions, but due to online mode we were asked to only model the product with cost analysis of fabrication. Proficiency in Software like ADAMS, ANSYS, MATLAB etc. were needed for the simulations.","Exams were on a harder side, it required problem solving practice for all the topics covered. Questions had to be practiced from course books beforehand to perform good. One quiz was conducted of 1 hour, numerical questions were asked based on stress, strain, elastic-plastic behavior. It was basically a ME201 exam. Midsem had questions from stress tensor, failure theory and material selection. While Endsem consisted of numericals on gears, shafts, bearings etc and some theoretical questions. Stress-strain theory was covered in depth in all of the exams.","This is mostly a culmination of your Mechanical journey, so there is no future importance in any core course. Though it can help in some electives like ME 669 which also deals with material selection process.

 2.) Sociological Concepts - The various terms and definitions that are relevant around Sociology like Culture, Society, Social Institutions, etc.
 3.) Sociological Thinkers - thinkers and founders like Auguste Comte, Karl Marx, Emile Durkheim
 4.) Social Change and Modernization - how sociology is relevant in the current day and age and Secularisation in India

Studying last minute will be difficult because the slides and recordings are not at all structured well, and are very difficult to study from.","While this course isnâ€™t as important in the technical point of view, it is a very important course in order to understand human relations and this course helps think about society from an outside perspective which is vital to make any executive decisions.",The professor keeps sending papers and reference materials throughout the class for relevant details if you are interested in the topic to read. My recommendation would be to follow the course content online through interesting youtube videos (â€œcrash course sociologyâ€ is a very good playlist available online that I followed) and case studies,
HS101 - Economics,"Tara Shankar Shaw,Puja Padhi","The premidsem part was of microeconomics while post midsem part was of macroeconomics. Neither of the parts had very complex concepts, following the lectures/learning from the reference book was quite easy.",There were 3 lectures of 1 hour every week for Prof. Shaw. No extra effort was required apart from watching the lectures. (One could skip the lectures as well and simply read the ref. book Mankiw for both parts which covered majority of the course curriculum),There was no mandatory attendance.,None.

 35 mark quiz worth 35%","The first half (microeconomics) started from the basic principles of economics, mainly covered concepts of supply and demand, invisible hand, and focused on decisions of individual firms. Production, competitive markets, monopolies were covered. A fairly quantitative rather than qualitative approach was taken in the entire course. In macroeconomics, supply and demand of market as a whole was studied as opposed to that of a single firm. Measuring national income (GDP, GNP etc.), cost of living (CPI, WPI), inflation, the monetary system, basic tools of finance were the main topics covered.","3 lectures of 1 hr every week were taken by Prof. Shaw. At the end, some recorded videos were also posted to complete the curriculum. The prof encouraged discussion in the class even if it wasnâ€™t strictly a part of the syllabus. Overall everything was taught very well by him.
 Most lectures of Prof. Puja Padhi ended in 30-35 minutes. Too much terminology was introduced in the first few lectures which was difficult to follow. Slides were also not very useful and prof herself mentioned that the reference book was more important. There wasnâ€™t a lot of discussion in the lectures although the prof tried to encourage it. The last few topics were taught well.",There were none !,"Quiz 1 (Microeconomics) : Very straightforward, questions asked directly from lectures/reference book.","Although it doesnâ€™t help with future mech courses, it was a pretty interesting course. It gave me some insights into business decision making and some counterintuitive aspects of markets and economies.","For this course, Mankiwâ€™s books for both micro and macro are extremely useful. Personally, I relied more on the books than the lectures, as the books also deliver the content in an interesting format with lots of real life examples.
 For the micro exams, I would strongly suggest going through previous year exams and solutions.",

The slides were detailed and were sourced from the books recommended by the professor himself. The lectures involved more of the conceptual aspects and the actual problem solving was done in tutorials. He also scribbled diagrams on a whiteboard often to explain some of the more intricate concepts. Extra lectures were conducted regularly but it played out well in the end - got an extra week off before endsems. Students were initially worried to ask questions because of the strict policies but everything eased out eventually.,"Often, the tutorials were not in sync with the lectures and that resulted in additional effort. The tutorials are very important because questions very similar to them pop up in the exams. The tutorials will often get stretched beyond teaching hours. No assignments were given during the duration of the course.","The exams were conducted on safe app. All questions were of subjective type and a very definite marking scheme was followed. Cribbing was essential as close alternative solutions very heavily penalised. However, the feedback was incorporated into the grading later on and the marking improved. 
 The quizzes were often too long to finish in time. All exams derived inspiration from the tutorials and also often asked explanations of concepts taught in the class

The professor allowed considerable freedom in choice of topics, so there were topics as varied as deep reinforcement learning, financial market models, poker theory, spacecraft rendezvous and so on. Students had at least a month to read the paper and summarize it in a few slides.","The only exams were the take-home quizzes. For the most part, the questions were quite easy and based on the class discussions. There was no time pressure either, so one could give the exam based on convenience.","For starters, it is a part of the DS minor basket.

 Both the exams were take home where we were given around 2 weeks to solve the paper. The entire paper would have a single problem statement (for instance, the midsem was on a robotic manipulator and the endsem was on spacecraft attitude control) with various sub parts. These subparts were more like stepping stones to the next subpart. Both the exams were simulation based and we had to plot the various quantities asked for. However, the mathematics used to derive at the simulation had to be shown in the report.

Maâ€™am also used to pick people randomly before the lecture and ask them to summarise the previous lecture. So, it is expected that one maintains a level of consistency with regards to the course delivery. As for the second part of the course, students were expected to go through some case study papers or other reading material before a lecture(in some cases) but these tasks are much less time consuming then the prior ones. For the course as a whole it would be a good idea for students to make note of important points during lectures because a lot of things are discussed in the class which generally are not even described in the lecture slides.","80% attendance is mandatory. But if you think you can get done with this course without attending lectures you are wrong! ATTENDING LECTURES IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR THIS COURSE!!!! Even if you do this one thing sincerely, youâ€™ll get through very smoothly.","This is an introductory course to marketing. Hence, none!","Part1: 5% individual assignment. 15% - best 3 of 4 group activities (weekly basis), 10% - group presentation, 20% - Midsem.","Nature & scope of core marketing concepts and tasks, market environment scanning, consumer behavior and customer value, market segmentation, targeting and positioning, product and brand concepts, pricing decisions, marketing channels : distribution and direct marketing, marketing communication and promotion, personal selling, marketing information system, sales forecasting and marketing research.",The overall teaching style is very good!! Both of the instructors do an extremely good job delivering the content. There are a lot of scenarios and case studies that are discussed. The content can be easily followed.,Most of the assignments either serve as tests to your concept understanding or are based on application of the concepts that you have learned during the lectures. Some questions may get challenging at times and you might have to ponder upon them for some time with your pals!,"Midsem- Was based on the content delivered in part 1. It was divided into 3 rounds:-
 Round 1: - Moodle based MCQ questions. Had to answer 15 questions in 10 minutes.
 Round 2: -Match given companies with given promotion strategies.
 Round 3: - A different brand was allocated to each student. Everyone had to write a detailed description of the brand based on a given set of instructions and our learning from the course. It was an open book question.",Serves as the requirement for the MG407 course. (other courses may also serve as alternatives though),"All relevant resources are shared by the professors.

 Since the class size was very large, the lectures were mostly monologues, and not very interesting.","3 out of the 4 assignments were extremely coding heavy, and required students to implement various algorithms in Python (using libraries). The other assignment was mathematical, based on the concepts taught in class.
 The project was very well-structured and the professor expected everyone to spend a lot of work on technical as well as non-technical areas.","The solitary quiz was mathematical and tested basic knowledge of statistics and probability.
 The manner of conduct of the endsem was quite interesting. The question paper was released on Moodle with a list of questions and tasks to perform. The professor had created a portal from where each student could download a personalized data set by requesting for an OTP. The coding tasks had to be performed and a report had to be submitted online within 24 hours of requesting the OTP. The portal was open for about a week, so students could do it whenever they found it convenient.","Quite good as an introductory ML course. Certainly more non-technical than the contemporaries in the CSE, CSRE, EE and DS departments, while still providing a decent flavour of a plethora of ML concepts.","The Elements of Statistical Learning by Hastie, Tibshirani et al is quite useful.",5th semester.

 The teaching was really good and interactive, but it occasionally seemed that the professor was going quite fast. The professor was however very receptive to doubts and would repeat things multiple times in case someone brought it up.",The assignments were quite coding heavy.,"Midsem was pretty standard, most questions were based on the class discussions. There were a few tricky questions, but in general it was quite easy to score about 60-70% without much effort.","Machine learning will soon be ubiquitous and whether youâ€™re interested in CSE or not, every field would soon be using ML as a means to an end.

There is a scope of improvement in terms of content delivery. Content was not well organized in my opinion but prof was open to any suggestion or changes for the improvement of content. The course is more inclined towards theoretical and the mathematical side of machine learning and requires one to be familiar with concepts from probability and linear algebra.,"There were two assignments in the course which provided a good learning curve in terms of application of ML concepts real dataset. Both the assignments were programming based. Having familiarity with Python and NumPy will be beneficial.

AE706 - Computational Fluid Dynamics,J.C. Mandal,The initial portion of the course dealt with fluid mechanics and governing equations which were a bit tough. The finite difference techniques that followed were easy - moderate. The coding assignments had to be done in C/C++ only. They were a major part of learning in the course.,You would need to revise at least an hour per week along with attending the lectures. The coding assignments will take up some time depending on your proficiency with C/C++. But the time commitment for the coding assignments will go down as you get familiar with C/C++ through the course.,The prof had instructed about strict attendance at the beginning of the course but did not implement the policy as DX grade was not allowed in online sem.,"Although there are no hard prerequisites other than basic Fluid Dynamics, doing a course on Gas Dynamics would ensure better understanding of some of the governing equations and their analysis. That being said, Gas Dynamics is not essential to understand the CFD part of the course.
 Decent knowledge of C/C++ is a hard prerequisite as the professor does not accept coding assignments in any other language. Knowledge of linear algebra and basic differential equations would help in the course.",1.Introduction to Computational Fluid Dynamics,1.Introduction to Computational Fluid Dynamics,The professor would use MS Whiteboard during the lectures and provide the whiteboard file afterwards. He was very open to answering doubts and would even wait after the lectures if doubts werenâ€™t solved. The content pertaining to CFD is taught right from the basics and is taught with examples in a manner which is easy to understand,The coding assignments were the most fun part of the course as you would apply the knowledge learnt in class and write codes from scratch for various finite difference schemes.,The Midsem was pretty easy as most of the question has been dealt with in some form in the class. The Endsem on the other hand was tough and it involved application of whatever was leant throughout the course. The quizzes were moderate and doable if attention was paid in class.,This course is important if you want to pursue CFD in a theoretical setting. It will form the foundation of CFD as you take more advanced courses.,"1.Numerical Computation of Internal and External Flows: The Fundamentals of Computational Fluid 
 Dynamics: Volume 1 and Volume 2, Charles Hirsch, Butterworth-Heinemann",I took this course in my 4th sem. I would recommend the same as one would have completed Fluid Mechanics in the 3rd sem and would also get sufficient time to explore other courses related to CFD if interested.
AE240 - Spaceflight Mechanics,Ashok Joshi,"The course content is not that difficult, itâ€™s a scale-up of basic physics and mathematics but continuous evaluation with surprise class tests and the course project make it a little more difficult than moderate. The knowledge required to make a good course project is sometimes more than what is covered in the course and hence it requires extra effort and studying from different sources.","As mentioned before, it requires continuous involvement for class tests and extra effort for the course project. But then, most of the preparation for the Quizzes and Midsem/Endsem is done by this already.","No attendance/No DX grade but then to catch the surprise test you need to attend lectures, at least those lectures in which the probability of happening of a class test is high.

 Orbital Mechanics for Engineering Students - Howard D Curtis",Since its a basic level/introductory course itâ€™s good to take this course in the 4th semester so that if you build strong interest in the field you have time to take advanced courses of the same. Also this course runs mostly in the even/spring semester so going till 6th semester for taking this course would be a little late. This course is part of the list of courses for Aerospace minor and hence if you are taking it as a minor course then the ideal semester to take it would depend upon how you have planned to complete your minor itself.

He would occasionally schedule live sessions for discussing doubts, but very few people attended. He also provided us slides from a previous offering of the course (the one whose videos are recorded).
 Hence, synchronous teaching was taken out of the question, and the course proceeded very much like a self-study course.","Tutorials were conducted in the lecture slot - two problems were flashed on the screen and we had to solve and submit them on Moodle within a few hours.

Then it moved onto optimizing the cost of production and the machining time. This was followed by modern machining techniques (Electro jet machining, ultrasonic machining and other chemical and thermal methods). Lastly, basic quality control techniques were covered. Due to less time, topics like jigs and fixtures were scrapped from the syllabus.","Sir used slides and covered a lot of content orally so it became very important to either attend classes or at least watch the recordings. Sir would annotate the pdfs to explain concepts but would erase them before uploading the slides, that made it all the more important to watch/attend lectures. For those who attended classes, sir would randomly ask questions so it was important to stay focussed in class.","There were no tutorials so all the practice was either through in slide questions or through the assignments that were given to us. The assignments were lengthy but since we could do it in a group, dividing and conquering was the way forward. For the projects, sir gave us an option to either perform simulations or do a literature review. Sir was very particular about the way the slides were presented and wanted more images and less text (also do put in page numbers). After the presentation, he would ask questions to each group member in order to ensure that everyone played a part in making the presentation.","Quizzes (MS forms):
 The quizzes were earlier unannounced and would be a surprise. In the first half of the course, each question (MCQ/numerical type, etc.) had negative marking and this coupled with less time would result in a poor class average. However, later on, sir agreed to limit the negative marks to MCQs only and also gave us extra time. This was however at the cost of additional class time (would extend into the lunch break).

 Prof. Amber was very interactive and would try to engage the class in whatever way was possible.",The solitary assignment had 4 long answer type numerical questions that had to be solved and turned in within about 3 days.,"Prof. Amber used a novel technique to conduct all his exams. Exams would usually have an objective section and a subjective section. The objective section was a Moodle quiz that would contain n questions to be solved in n/2 minutes (n ~ 10-15), which means that only those who had studied the slides thoroughly would be able to complete the question paper.
 The subjective section had about 4 long-answer questions, but the professor would upload one question at a time on Moodle. Students had about 10-15 minutes once a question was uploaded to submit their solution on Moodle, following which he would reveal the next question.
 This pattern took some getting-used to, but was highly rewarding for those who took the pains to read the slides and practise problems beforehand.

Slides are usually sufficient.","Tutorials were conducted almost every fourth lecture. These were tutorials in name only, since they were on SAFE and had way too many questions - making it virtually impossible to complete even a single tutorial. The professor would occasionally give hints regarding the problems though. Questions were a mix of subjective and objective questions (multiple correct answer type).
 The individual project had two components of which students could choose any one. The first option was to build a hand-driven flexible link mechanism meeting certain conditions using household-items such as ice-cream sticks, cardboard, pins, CDs etc. The virtual analogue was to code the simulation of a reasonably complex mechanism on MATLAB from scratch. Given that all this only constituted for 5% of the total grade, and a final presentation would happen a week after the endsems, the professor later agreed to make the course project optional.
 There was still an individual viva conducted a week after the endsems where the professor asked some basic questions from the course for about 10 minutes.","The quizzes, midsem and endsem followed the same template of the tutorials, on SAFE, extremely lengthy and tedious. Only the endsem was open-notes.

Prof. Abhishek would be around in the lectures and would occasionally conduct doubt sessions, but did not teach anything as such.
 Teaching was reasonably slow and covered real-life applications of the topics. The class interaction was quite healthy. While slides were provided, they were typically taciturn and one would have to also study from class notes in order to do well in the exams.","Weekly Tutorials - Probably the most significant component of the course evaluation. A tutorial session was held every other week, but from my experience, it was quite futile. Questions were incredibly lengthy and often very tedious. The professors make all of the questions on their own and it isnâ€™t even remotely close to anything youâ€™ll ever find online. Most of the problems are design or simulation based and heavily involves MATLAB. For someone with no functional knowledge of MATLAB and a solid understanding of the content covered in class, the tutorials would be a really arduous task.","Quizzes were typically easy and short and a mix of objective and subjective type questions. Easily the most scoring component of the entire course.
 The midsem and endsem were quite lengthy and resembled the tutorials to a great extent. There were several design-based problems, but in the absence of MATLAB, one would often have to indulge in dreadfully long calculations to obtain an estimate of the answer. Several questions in the paper carried a very high weightage (17-20 in an 80 mark paper) and consisted of tens of sub-questions one following another. So, if someone made a mistake in one of the earlier sub-parts, they would end up losing a large fraction of their grade.
 The exams and tutorials werenâ€™t evaluated very leniently and class averages were not very high either.","Provides a glimpse of the Controls field, in a way what SysCon does in a nutshell. If you liked the field, you can also consider picking up some Controls electives from SysCon.","Surprisingly, very little of the material is even remotely traceable online.

ME308 - IEOR,"Avinash Bhardwaj, Makarand Kulkarni","The course runs in two parts. For me, OR (Avinash Bhardwaj) was pre-midsem and IE (Makarand Kulkarni) was post-midsem.
 OR: Can be quite challenging without prior aptitude or exposure towards rigorous math
 IE: Reasonably easy to follow based on lecture videos, however certain concepts were quite vaguely explained","OR: Heavy, at least 3 hours a week in addition to regular classes

 IE: Quality Control Mechanisms, Production Control Mechanisms, Inventory Control Mechanisms, Failure Control Mechanisms","OR: Lecture videos (from an older offering of another course that the professor takes) would be uploaded periodically and the lecture slot would be used for conducting quizzes and discussing doubts
 IE: The professor started with taking live lectures, but as the attendance dropped to single digits, he started uploading recorded lectures instead of live classes",None,"OR: Quizzes would contain far too many questions and would become near impossible to completely attempt. They would also be governed by a horrendous marking scheme, which eventually meant that the class average for some quizzes would be negative. The midsem was a 24-hour take-home exam. The professor was very strict about the use of internet and any answers even remotely appearing to resemble something found online would be awarded zero. Again, this resulted in an abysmal class average for the midsem.
 IE: Quizzes were numerical answer type on SAFE, with marks being allotted only in case the final numerical answer was exactly correct. No marks were awarded for steps. Time was often insufficient, but not as much as the OR quizzes.
 The endsem was a regular pen-paper exam with only theoretical questions, picked up from the slides.","The OR part would be the equivalent of the first half of most optimization courses in the institute, so that certainly means that it opens avenues for a lot of computational sciences. However, you would be better off doing a proper optimization course since the OR part of ME308 only scratches the surface.
 The IE part would be relevant for those students pursuing a dual degree specializing in CIM. Consequently, a lot of courses in Manufacturing Automation, Lean Manufacturing and Production Management open up for you.","OR: Introduction to Linear Optimization (Bertsimas and Tsitsiklis)

ME221 - Structural Materials,Sushil Mishra,"Overall the course is moderate level, both in terms of the content and the evaluations that would happen. Around 50% of the course revolves around 3-4 major concepts like Iron-Carbon phase diagram, Heat treatment, Phase transformations, Dislocations and their movements etc. The next 30% is on some small concepts like Mechanical properties, Fracture & Fatigue, Strengthening & Softening etc. The remaining 20% of the topics are just for knowledge and information, and the professor wonâ€™t ask many questions from this section either, although they are all important applications of the previously covered topics. It includes Composites, Alloys, Ceramics etc. The major effort one needs to take is in the first section and once that is done, the rest of the course goes very smoothly.","The course is a little involving, as there are multiple group assignments to be done, due every 2nd or 3rd week. Also these assignments are followed by a quiz in the coming week after the assignment deadline.

Heâ€™ll also use the digital whiteboard to explain concepts and you can access those anytime on MS teams. All the other material and slides will also be available on MS teams. The professor is more concerned about the learning of the students, conducting exams or giving grades are his last priority. This makes the overall atmosphere of the course very positive. If you just follow what he teaches then, with a little bit of time revising PPTs would do the job. He will spend most of the time explaining stuff on the white board and often leave the â€œjust for informationâ€ part for you to read in your free time. The professorâ€™s teaching is quite engaging, and to keep you attentive in the class he would randomly ask anyone to unmute and answer some questions.","The group assignments are the most interesting part of the course, after the professorâ€™s teaching.

He spends 1 full lecture on problem solving every alternate week.","No project, no assignments and no tutorials. But after the end of every major section, the professor would give some questions for practice. These questions are very important as they help a lot in understanding the concepts as well as the questions asked in the exams are very similar to these. No submission is required for these questions, and the professor would discuss these questions in the class before giving the next set of questions.","Exams for this course would be pretty easy, the questions revolve around the lecture slides and the practice questions. Although the questions in the exams would look difficult in the way they are framed, they are easily solvable if you know the concepts from the lectures. Exams are conducted with no live proctoring, you will be given the question paper via Moodle and asked to record your laptop screen as well as your camera feed using OBS on your laptop. After the end of the exam time you need to upload your answer sheets on Moodle and recordings on the course drive. Grading is lenient, in fact super chill. The professor wonâ€™t cut a single mark if your final answer is incorrect provided the logic you applied and the equations you formed are correct. Enough time is available in the exams to solve all the questions, quizzes consist of 1-2 questions and Midsem/Endsem would have 5-6 questions.

The batch was divided into two groups, and every group was assigned one day in a week (either Monday or Tuesday depending upon the group) on which they could come and discuss the concepts and doubts that they may have after watching the previous weekâ€™s videos. Every Thursday, the professor would keep a common doubt clearing session (during the lecture slot) for both groups in case someone wished to join in and get something clarified. Apart from this, there were question sheets attached to Prof. Gaitondeâ€™s resource as well, which the professor would give us as assignments/HWs. He would also take up some of the tricky questions during the lectures/sessions.","The question sheets comprised of a good number of questions and had all types - easy ones, lengthy ones, some difficult ones etc. Served as good practice material, which is essential in this course. The solutions/procedure were also either discussed by the professor in the sessions or made available by the TAs, so one could always cross-check. Although it is advised that one should solve the questions and try it once, before looking up the solutions or taking any sort of help.","The exams were often on the trickier and lengthier side, with most questions consuming a fair amount of time owing to their length along with the thinking involved to solve them. No questions were absolutely straightforward although there were a handful of easy ones as well in every paper. This applies for both the quizzes as well as the endsem. All the exams were predominantly subjective-type.

ME202 - Strength of Materials,Dnyanesh Pawaskar,Syllabus wise the course is of medium difficulty. It includes concepts that are built upon basics. The main challenge is to solve the problems. Even the simplest problems need to have an approach strategy that once figured out then moves on to rigorous solving. The theory is explained pretty well in depth by the instructor with detailed notes and plenty of example problems. In-class tutorials with questions based on real-time applications,"Understanding the theory is simple as mentioned before, although time requires to be spared for problem-solving. Solving tutorial questions is sufficient to get started but it is good to try questions from the recommended books.",No attendance policy,ME201 - Solid Mechanics,,"Notes were written on the blackboard entirely, tutorial problems were solved in class first and solutions posted later. No electronics presentation shared. Plenty of books suggested for reference.",,,,,,
ME202 - Strength of Materials,Prof. Krishna S. Jonnalagadda,Moderate (Mainly focussing on the applications of theory learnt in ME 201 and building up on it),"Initially it is easy to cope with the course, provided you are clear with the basics of ME 201. Students who have not done ME 201 under him, might require a little extra effort to get used to the pattern. Homeworks are doable, but gradually the tutorials start getting lengthy and involved and require some effort (around an hour) before the tutorials. This course focuses mainly on applications and problem solving and with continuous evaluation, on an average it requires around 2 hrs per week apart from the class hours.","Attendance is taken, but not used for DX.

MA214 - Introduction to Numerical Analysis,Prof. S. Baskar,Difficult,"The course had 3 hours of lectures and a weekly tutorial session (8 credits!). The course is mathematically involved and thatâ€™s what one should expect from a 8 credit MA course (:p), although the first half of the course was relatively easy. It requires regular revision of previously learnt concepts because the newer concepts build on the already learnt ones. Also since the course had 3 quizzes, it required studying on a regular basis rather than procrastinating and burning the midnight oil just before the exam. So if one is attentive in the class and attends the tutorial sessions regularly then four hours per week would help you sail through the course easily.","80% attendance compulsory, else DX grade (eventually he ended up giving up no DX grade for our batch due to some glitch in ASC portal but donâ€™t expect that to happen again).

No fail grades were awarded.,"None. Although the instructor had an interesting policy. He would announce surprise quizzes at the start of a week. The quiz would be conducted anytime that week, in class or in the tutorial. That made for a pretty anxious week and the classes were always packed :).","None, although a thorough grasp of the contents of MA 105, MA 106 and MA 108 will be a bonus and can help you score much better than your peers. There were points for class participation as well, although it was unclear as to how this was used to grade students, given that attendance wasnâ€™t mandatory.",,"The professor used to write stuff on the whiteboard and students would copy it down. No supplementary material was shared. Thereâ€™s no real way to catch up if you miss a class, because the material is picked up from a wide range of sources. Since the course is intended as a mathematical primer for M. Techs and PhDs, you may find the initial part of the course slow and repetitive. The course picks up pace in the latter half, though.
 The prof is very enthusiastic and gives personal attention to each student in class, regularly asking people to come up to the board and answer questions. He is also very receptive to doubts and may often spend entire lectures devoted to one doubt (which may be frustrating at times).",,,,,,

These weekly coding assignments would require approximately 3-5 hours per week depending on the topic and adeptness in Python coding.,"Attendance above 90% ensure full 5 points in the final evaluation, and a linear mapping was followed for attendance below 90%",An introductory course in coding (like CS101) is crucial while knowledge of Python is a plus although you can learn it as the course proceeds,,"Essentials of Statistics, Introduction to Data Mining, Regression, Classification and Clustering (k-means and hierarchical) algorithms: Linear regression, Multiple linear regression, Logistic regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Bagging, Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Bayesian LDA & QDA, Concept of overfitting, Bias-variance tradeoff, Resampling and Cross-validation, Regularization, Principal component analysis, knn regression, Big Data Analytics, Techniques for storing and processing Big Data, Introduction to Keras - Convolution neural networks, ResNets, LSTMs",,,,,,

ME651 - Fluid Dynamics,Prof. Avishek Ranjan,"The course builds all the principles one learnt in ME 219: Fluid Mechanics (UG). It re-constructs the Bernouliiâ€™s equation, statics, then moves to Reynolds transport theorem, and differential analysis of the Navier Stokes equations. Till the mid-sem, everything is a repetition of ME219, and hence â€˜easyâ€™ in the ideal sense. The later part is tougher than ME219 per se, as it covers more advanced topics, such as vorticity dynamics, LES/RANS modeling of Navier Stokes equations. I particularly donâ€™t think the student will feel this course as difficult if they performed decently in ME219. I would rate it a 7/10 in terms of difficulty.","The classes are worth 3 hours per week. There were a total of 5 assignments in the course, with a week to complete them, and around 7-10 questions in each assignment based on the previous set of lectures. Ideally should take 4-5 hours in those weeks to complete the assignments. The questions are moderately tough for most part, and only require â€˜minimalâ€™ thinking. However, they are lengthy. Some questions are interesting, and require thinking, but are very few. So 4-5 hours, 5 times a semester is enough for the assignments. For regular reading, I would say devoting 2 hours a week should be more than enough if the student listens to the lectures properly.","No attendance policy. However, there are 2 surprise quizzes, one pre-mid sem and one post-midsem, combined weightage of 5-10%. The pre-mid sem quiz should be relatively easy for everyone as it is a repetition of ME219. The post-mid sem quiz requires the student to have some knowledge of the material covered in lectures. Overall, moderately tough. The quizzes were both conducted near the mid sem/end sem week","ME 219 is mandatory in the sense itâ€™s an odd sem course, to be completed in 3rd semester, and this course runs in the even semester.

Both these aspects are covered but not into too much detail on the theoretical side, just an essential touch is given. Since this course is more of application based one requires a basic theoretical understanding of control systems, experience with microcontrollers and electrical breadboard circuits otherwise it is really difficult to cope up with the exams and assignments.

It is math-heavy to some extent, but definitely coding heavy & with a total of 5 assignments, needs a major chunk of time each week. The exams are highly application oriented, although one may find a direct question about the proof of an algorithm occasionally. The course project is also pretty doable. If one is not familiar with Fourier transforms, ramping up will need some extra efforts. Overall difficulty could be rated as 7/10.","The lectures for this course accounted for 3 hours each week.
