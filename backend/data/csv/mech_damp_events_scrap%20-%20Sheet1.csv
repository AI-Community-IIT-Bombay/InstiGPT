"Aniruddha Ranade (CADA):Aniruddha decided to convert to DD after his third year. According to him, the third-year electives he took were vital in determining his area of specialization. He took some TFE courses and found them a little restrictive. So, he switched to CADA and found its curriculum pretty relaxed with the flexibility of choosing courses from departments like SysCon, Aerospace. He was a part of the satellite team and wanted to explore more in his field of interest of aerodynamic systems design. He took a problem statement inspired by his Satellite team experience for his DD project. However, he chose to do his DD in the mechanical department and not the aerospace department as he found a suitable guide for his research interest in the mechanical department., Prathik Reddy (CADA):Prathik is a part of the IITB racing team, and his love for the work he did in the Racing team as well as course projects was instrumental for him choosing CADA as his specialization. According to him, to decide the area of specialization, it is highly suggested to try out multiple courses in each specialization. Or the choice of specialization can be aligned with the work you did in some Tech team or any other extra-curricular work in general. He hasnâ€™t done any SysCon courses; some of his courses were from Energy and Aerospace departments, his courses from Mechanical were mostly on vibrational analysis and design., Shantanu Thada (TFE):Shantanu decided to convert to DD after his third-year university research internship. He got an opportunity to work on the topic related to thermal and fluids Engineering during his internship and decided to work closely on TFE for his Masterâ€™s thesis. His guide was from Aerospace Engineering, and his co-guide from the Mechanical Engineering department was Prof. Arunkumar Sridharan. He worked on his project six months longer than the ideal period and published two research papers. He believed that converting to DD was instrumental in improving his CPI, creating better prospects at securing a job or higher studies., Athul Nambolan (CIM):Athul branched changed from Aerospace to Mechanical DD in his second year. He was a part of the AUV team from his first year, which made him realize that his interests lie in the Design (CADA) and Manufacturing (CIM) part of mechanical systems. He decided to specialize in CIM after his third year when he took up an elective course on Rapid Manufacturing, where he had a chance to visit a diamond cutting factory in Surat. He also briefly discussed the current research topics prevalent in CIM relating to IoT, Computer vision, Micromachining, Additive manufacturing, etc., Naman Agarwal (CIM):Naman also decided to opt for DD after his third year. He was not very interested in the Core part of Mech and wanted to dive into coding, ML, or AI. He decided to opt for specialization in CIM after he had a chance to do a project with Professor Amber Shrivastava related to Computer Vision. His DDP project is based on Computer vision itself for the Detection of Defects in Welding. He also highlighted that if someone is interested in fields like AI, ML, Data analytics, there are professors in Mech who are working in these domains combining CIM/Mech with Data analytics/Machine Learning techniques., Q&A:How Math intensive are SysCon (CADA) courses?
 Typically they are heavy in maths. Check SysCon MTech (1 year) courses, these are not so heavy, but follow-up courses to these will be rigorous in maths. Sitting through a few weeks of lectures and reading course reviews could be an excellent point to start to see if your interest aligns with the topic.,",Dual Degree Specialization Session (2021)
"Anish Ram Senathi:He graduated last year and was interested in robotics and ML during his stay in IIT B.
 Some opportunities in the department present in these fields:
 (Some prior coding knowledge, interest in data analytics and ML during the first year but later went on to gain interest in the field of computational solid mechanics)., Kanishka Panda:The session recording can be found here, Dewashish Kumar Dey:The session recording can be found here, Vinayak Agarwal:The session recording can be found here,",Where are they now?

"The session was taken by Shantanu Thada (TFE), Aniruddha Ranade (CADA), and Anant Joshi (IDDDP in SysCon). The seniors talked about the points they considered while opting for DD conversion. Shantanu decided to convert to DD after his third-year university research internship. He got an opportunity to work in a field closely related to his internship topic for his Master’s thesis. His guide was from the aerospace department with a co-guide from the mechanical department. He started working on his DDP from 8th semester itself, so that chances of a publication increase and he can get the most out of the research experience the institute has to offer. He also believed that converting to DD was instrumental in improving his CPI, creating better prospects at securing a job or higher studies. Also, he emphasized on the point that one saves a year of education as well as a considerable amount of money as compared to doing a masters abroad. Aniruddha also decided to convert to DD after his third-year internship. He was highly inclined towards building and exploring technical areas during his institute life as a part of the Student Satellite Team and other projects. He wanted to explore more in his field of interests of aerodynamic systems design. He talked to Prof. Salil Kulkarni about the possibilities, and decided on the final problem statement. However, he chose to do his DD in the mechanical department and not the aerospace department as he found a suitable guide for his research interest in the mechanical department. Furthermore, CADA offered great freedom in the selection of courses, and it had grown into quite an inclusive program. Anant converted to DD after his third-year internship as well. Anant had been working with professors in the SysCon department for quite some time during his institute life. He was also pursuing a minor in SysCon. He talked to a professor in the SysCon department, who was ready to be his guide for his Master’s thesis. Moreover, since he had already been doing various courses from the SysCon department, he would not have very high courseload if he converted. As he was already very familiar with the type of research going on in the institute, combined with the fact that having a Masters degree would help him for his PhD applications, he decided to go for a DD in SysCon. Procedure to be followed: An application form has to be filled and approved by the FacAd and the HoD. The form should highlight your motivation for converting to DD and a rough timeline of completing the additional coursework and sent to DUGC. The DUGC takes the final decision. For conversion to IDDDP, the guidelines are available here.The recording of the session can be found here. Session Summary by: Pruthak Joshi",Dual Degree Conversion Session (2020)
