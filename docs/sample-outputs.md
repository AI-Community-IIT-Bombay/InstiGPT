## What is the purpose of a seminar?

Seminars are a course wherein under the guidance of a faculty member a student is expected to do an in-depth study in a specialized area by doing a survey of published technical literature and understand different aspects of the problem.

## What is A.P. grade?

According to the grading system followed by the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, the AP grade is awarded to students with exceptional performance. It is the highest grade that can be achieved in a course. The AP grade carries a grade point of 10, which is the highest possible grade point.

## How to calculate CPI?

The Cumulative Performance Index (CPI) is calculated in a manner similar to the calculation of SPI. It considers all the courses registered by the student towards the minimum requirement of the degree they have enrolled for, since they entered the Institute. The CPI is calculated at the end of every semester to two decimal places.

The formula for calculating CPI is:

CPI = (C1g1 + C2g2 + C3g3 + ... + Cngn) / (C1 + C2 + C3 + ... + Cn)

where:

C1, C2, C3, ..., Cn are the credits of the courses taken by the student
g1, g2, g3, ..., gn are the grade points obtained by the student in the respective courses

Even if a student has failed in a course more than once, the course will figure only once in the numerator as well as the denominator.

The CPI will reflect the failed status in case of FR grade(s), till the course(s) is/are cleared. When the course(s) is/are cleared by obtaining a pass grade on subsequent registration(s), the CPI will only reflect the new grade and not the fail grades earned earlier.

## How is CPI and SPI different?

I do not have information on CPI and SPI. Hence, I cannot answer your question.

## What is the difference between FR and FF grade?

According to the sources of IIT Bombay, an "FR" grade is awarded in cases where the student's performance is below an acceptable threshold in the in-semester and/or end-semester examinations, or for academic malpractices. On the other hand, an "FF" grade is specifically awarded to UG students by the concerned course instructor. Students will be given only one chance for re-examination in case of an FF grade, otherwise the grade will be converted to FR.

## What are minor and honors courses?

**Minor Courses:**

- A minor is an additional credential that a student can earn by completing a set of courses in a discipline other than their major.
- Minor courses are allocated to students through a pre-registration process before the start of every semester.
- The allocation is done on the basis of the student's CPI, as seats are limited in every minor course.
- Minor courses do not count in your core CPI.
- The only way to get a minor is through the pre-registration window.

**Honors Courses:**

- Honors is an additional credential that a student can earn by completing extra credits in their own discipline.
- The concerned department specifies the course requirements for earning honors.
- Honors courses are either advanced-level courses in your discipline or courses designed to give you more exposure to different areas of your discipline.
- On successful accumulation of credits at the end of the program, this will be mentioned in the Degree Certificate as "Bachelor of Technology in xxx, with honors."
- Dual Degree students have to do the honors courses by default.
- Honors courses do not count in your CPI other than for dual degree students.

## How much credits are needed to complete a dual degree?

The "B.Tech. + M.Tech. Dual Degree programme" should have all of the following components over and above the corresponding basic B.Tech. curriculum:

a) B.Tech Honours credit a minimum of 24 credits that can comprise of either only courses or a combination of courses and a Project. The Project duration can be of two semesters with a maximum of 18 credits.

b) 24 credits consisting of four masters level courses.

c) 72 credits of a masters' thesis spread over 14 months (e.g. summer between eighth and ninth semester, plus ninth and tenth semesters).
